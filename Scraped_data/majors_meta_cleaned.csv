1,"Architecture, B.S.","Architecture, B.S. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Architecture: Degree Programs At UVA School of Architecture, our undergraduate Architecture programs are framed by an innovative curriculum that addresses the many ways in which design shapes and invents the world around us. The work of our students and faculty is investigative, critical, articulate, experimental and rigorous. The undergraduate curriculum in Architecture introduces students to methodologies to critically understand and creatively transform the built environment. Design innovation requires creativity, technical knowledge, cultural awareness, risk-taking, and meaningful questioning. Our curriculum uses design as a mode of critical inquiry to explore questions and pose new visions for a range of scales, all of which constitute the disciplinary realm of architecture: from cities, territories, infrastructure, and buildings to rooms, installations, furniture, and clothing. The first year of study is a shared Common First Year curriculum, wherein students take courses in three School of Architecture departments: Architecture, Urban + Environmental Planning, and Architectural History.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Architecture: Degree Programs Undergraduate students entering the School of Architecture share a Common First Year in the School of Architecture curriculum. Students take core courses in Architectural History, Architecture, and Urban and Environmental Planning to provide a framework for the study of contemporary culture through observation, analysis, and design of built and natural environments. Students must pass each core course with a grade of C- or higher. During the spring semester of the first year, students choose an intended major: Bachelor of Architectural History, Bachelor of Science Architecture, or Bachelor of Urban and Environmental Planning. The Program in Urban and Environmental Planning balances professional planning skills and urban studies with a liberal arts education emphasizing interdisciplinary study. Students take courses in the social and natural sciences, the humanities, and in design fields that are complemented by professional planning and elective courses. Program graduates begin work in the public, private, or nonprofit sectors in urban and rural areas ranging from city and county planning offices to real estate and development firms to economic development agencies. Some students continue for graduate professional studies. The scope of the planner’s work encompasses present and future urban and environmental concerns, including such diverse issues such as environmental impact, quality of life, urban design, transportation, and the public and private costs of development and land use. Public sector planners work for all levels of government, formulating plans to redevelop or rehabilitate downtowns and neighborhoods, develop land aesthetically and profitably, create sustainable transportation plans, and regulate private development and impact to protect public interests. Planners frame long-range designs and shorter-term strategies that meet community plans and goals. Private sector planners employed with land developers, utilities, banks, property management firms, industries, architectural and design firms and other major corporations do similar work according to the particular concerns of each business. Planners in the nonprofit sector represent a variety of environmental, citizen advocacy, and community and economic development organizations.  Many of these concerns are integrated with the department’s focus on sustainable community development, social equity, and environmental planning, and pressing global challenges. Accreditation: The undergraduate program in Urban and Environmental Planning is accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board, sponsored jointly by the American Institute of Certified Planners and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning.

Prerequisites for Declaring the Major In order to declare the major, a student must have completed one anthropology course. Program Requirements Eleven courses (33 credits) taken within a program approved by a departmental undergraduate advisor are required for a major. These eleven courses may include courses taken before declaration of the major, and up to two from outside the Department of Anthropology. Courses taken outside the anthropology department, including courses transferred from other institutions or study-abroad programs, may count toward the area requirements for the major.  These credits are subject to approval by a major advisor.  The maximum number of credits is limited to six and a minimum of three is typically approved, but normally they may not count toward the above 3000-level requirement for the major. In order to declare a major, a student must have completed one anthropology course. Grades lower than C- (in anthropology) will not count toward the major. No course for the major may be taken on a CR/NC basis. Normally at least 18 credits must be taken after declaration of the major.

B.A. in Anthropology with a Specialist Concentration Students who major in anthropology have the option to work toward one of three specialized concentrations within the major, which will appear on their University transcript. To complete a concentration, students must complete all other requirements for the major, and fulfill the specific concentration requirements as listed below. A student may choose to specialize in one concentration only. Specific classes that can be counted toward each concentration can be found in the Appendix below, and on the Department website. Students should consult with concentration faculty when choosing courses, as these lists will be updated periodically, and not all classes will be offered in every semester. When selecting Concentration courses, students should keep in mind that a maximum of only two courses (6 credits) from beyond Anthropology (courses with other than an ANTH prefix) can be counted toward the Anthropology major. To declare a concentration, students should meet with the faculty advisor for that concentration. Contact information can be found on the Department website, or from the Director of Undergraduate Programs in Anthropology. The three concentrations are as follows: B.A. in Anthropology with Concentration in Culture and Communication The Culture and Communication concentration in Anthropology offers students a program of study focused on communicative practices across a diversity of world cultures, modalities of embodied discourse, and the technologically mediated channels that increasingly connect people around the globe. Work in this area ranges from the micro-scale of everyday dialogue to the transnational scale of commerce, migrations, politics, and development. The program prepares students to bring critical thinking and holistic conceptual tools to an increasingly globalized workplace. There communicative practices vary across almost every conceivable dimension and attention to cultural differences can mean the difference between communication and miscommunication, justice and injustice, and even life and death. Culture and Communication introduces students to theoretical approaches from linguistic anthropology, cognitive anthropology, and other anthropological subfields. It builds on interdisciplinary ties that include sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, conversation analysis, exchange theory, art, media, and mediated discourse analysis. It thus prepes students to understand the impact of differing modes of expression, cultural styles, and interactional genres on the accomplishment of group tasks, the creation of human connections, and the building of a globally interconnected world. Requirements: Fulfill all non-elective requirements for the B.A. in Anthropology, including the Linguistic Anthropology distribution requirement. When choosing electives toward your Anthropology major, include a total of four, as follows: 2-4 classes from Culture and Communication Concentration Course List A up to 2 classes from Culture and Communication Course List B B.A. in Anthropology with Concentration in Indigenous Worlds Students in this concentration will be exposed to ethnographic studies and anthropological theories devoted to “the Indigenous.” For anthropologists, this term commonly refers to the knowledges and worldviews of the many peoples who are our disciplinary interlocutors around the globe. In American contexts, “Indigenous” usually refers to First Peoples of the Western hemisphere, and includes Native American Studies. At the transnational scale, indigenous peoples’ movements are political realities, converging at sites like the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, and World Conservation Congress. This concentration takes an unbounded approach, engaging with all these perspectives and scales, and many others, without reducing “the Indigenous” to any of them. Students will be given the opportunity to engage with the vast array of possibilities for being human, studying for example both colonial-era encounters, and contemporary Indigenous relationships to issues such as sustainable livelihoods, public health, and environmental care. This concentration offers unique opportunities for interdisciplinary learning across two areas of distinction at UVA: Indigenous arts and curation, and the environmental humanities. Requirements: Fulfill all non-elective requirements for the B.A. in Anthropology. When choosing electives toward your Anthropology major, include the following: 3 classes from Indigenous Worlds Concentration Course List A 2 classes from Indigenous Worlds Concentration Course List B B.A. in Anthropology with a Concentration in Medical Anthropology, Ethics, and Care Students in this concentration will study a diverse range of factors that impact the body, and the ways that people understand, experience, and respond to states of health and illness.  Students will critically examine the complex ethical orientations that shape the manners in which people care for or abandon one another in various conditions of exposure, vulnerability, and well-being.  Anthropological knowledge and practice offer a unique resource for questioning our own assumptions on these and other matters. Students in this concentration will use such knowledge to address some of the most difficult problems we face today, and in so doing, help create the world anew. Requirements: Fulfill all non-elective requirements for the B.A. in Anthropology. When choosing electives toward your Anthropology major, include the following: ANTH 2280 Medical Anthropology 4 additional courses chosen from the Medical Anthropology Concentration Course List Independent Study in Anthropology For students who want to work on an individual research project, ANTH 4993 allows considerable flexibility. There is no formal limitation on the kind of project as long as, a faculty member is willing to direct it, but the project should not duplicate what is already available in a regular course. Applicants should have their projects roughly defined when they apply to the faculty member. The normal requirements for ANTH 4993 are a reading list comparable in substance to those in regular courses and a term paper and oral examination at the end of the semester. Distinguished Majors Program in Anthropology Students with superior academic performance are encouraged to apply for the departmental Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) in which they write a thesis demonstrating independent study of high quality. The requirements for admission to the DMP are: satisfaction of all College requirements as stated in this Record with a GPA of at least 3.25 in all university courses; a GPA of at least 3.400 in all courses taken as part of the anthropology major; Permission of an advisor, who may be any member of the departmental faculty willing to take on the responsibility of supervising the thesis and is normally someone to whom the students have already demonstrated their ability in an upper-level course; application for admission (normally in the spring semester of the Third Year) to the Director of the Distinguished Majors Program, by declaring their DMP graduation semester/year, and by including their relevant course transcripts showing their two cumulative GPAs, along with the selected thesis topic, and the names of the first and second faculty thesis advisors. On admission, student registers with the primary faculty advisor for ANTH 4998 in the first semester of the Program, and for ANTH 4999 in the second semester for revising and finalizing the thesis in consultation with the two faculty readers. A DMP thesis involving field research on human subjects requires the University’s IRB Approval. This should be acquired before beginning the fieldwork, with the help of the primary faculty advisor. In consultation with the Director of the Distinguished Majors Program. In the final semester of the Program, the student takes into account the criticisms and suggestions of the two advisors and other interested faculty members, and submits a finished thesis of approximately 10,000 words to the two advisors three weeks before the Grades Due date for the semester. For regular Spring Graduation, the thesis is to be submitted by April 15. The level of distinction awarded in a thesis is approved by both the faculty advisors. At the end of the spring semester each year, an oral Presentation of all DMP theses will be held in Brooks Hall Commons. Each Distinguished Major and his/her committee members will be present. Theses Presentations will be open to the public. Friends and faculty are invited. Any prospective and current DMP students wishing help in entering, setting up or conducting their Program should contact the DMP director (see Department website), and be in contact with their major advisor and the Director of Undergraduate Programs. Course Lists Courses at the 1000 and 2000 levels have no prerequisites or expectations of experience and are open to all students. Courses at the 3000 and 4000 level are advanced undergraduate courses and often assume that students have previous coursework in anthropology. These are general prerequisites and individual professors may consider other courses within or outside the department to be sufficient preparation. Courses at the 5000 level have third- or fourth-year status and prior course work in anthropology as a general prerequisite. These courses are designed primarily for majors and graduate students, but are open by permission to other qualified, sufficiently motivated undergraduates.

5,"Applied Statistics, B.A.","Applied Statistics, B.A. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: College of Arts & Sciences: Departments/Programs The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Applied Statistics provides students with a solid grounding the field of statistics, with particular attention paid to applications. Knowledge of statistics is becoming increasingly important in many fields, so that students completing this major will have many options available upon graduation. Students completing this major will be well prepared to design experimental studies, analyze data, and communicate results in a wide range of subject areas. They will also be well prepared to enter MS programs in statistics and related fields.  With a modest amount of advance planning students are able to complete an M.S. in Statistics at UVa with one additional year of study. Students interested in the B.A./M.S. program should visit the Department of Statistics website. Students who declare the B.A. in Applied Statistics have the option of choosing one of three concentrations within the major. These concentrations are Finance and Business, Biostatistics, and Data Science. The details of these concentrations are given below. The prerequisites to declare any of the concentrations are those listed below. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Requirements The BA in Applied Statistics requires five core courses and five restricted elective courses. In total the BA in Applied Statistics requires 30 credit hours, plus prerequisite courses. There are two lists of restricted elective courses, those that focus on data analysis and those that are more computational. Of the five restricted elective courses, at least three must be taken from the Data Analysis list. A grade of C- or higher is required for all prerequisite and major courses. Prerequisites: 15 -17 credit hours Students must have completed all prerequisite courses to declare the major. Students may use AP credit to satisfy the prerequisites.

Description of Capstone For the capstone, students will work in teams of 3 or 4 to complete an extensive data analysis project. The students and capstone faculty will work collaboratively to develop a hands-on project for each team to demonstrate knowledge and skill in data analysis, interpretation, and communication. Each project will require the team to determine the nature of the questions of interest; prepare data for analysis; select and perform the appropriate analysis; determine conclusions; and present the results. The capstone project will provide an opportunity to observe how students work through all aspects of a statistical analysis. Students will be guided and evaluated by the capstone faculty. The capstone experience will culminate with the submission of a final report, and a formal presentation. If a student fails the capstone course, the Director of Undergraduate Programs will meet with the student to determine a set of revisions and/or alternative academic activities to complete their project. A student who fails to complete their project may retake the course in a subsequent semester. Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) All catalogs © 2025 University of Virginia.

Department’s Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) is an opportunity for qualified undergraduates to undertake substantial, independent research projects while working closely with department faculty. Participants are prepared for advanced independent research and analysis by a required seminar in art historical theory, methods, and historiography. The program culminates in the submission of a DMP capstone project consisting of a significant piece of original research, such as a text with a length of about fifty pages, a digital humanities project, and exhibition project, etc. Students who successfully complete the program receive departmental honors, with a degree of Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction in art history. Students should ordinarily declare their intention to apply for admission to the program by the end of the spring semester of their third year with formal application for admission to the program submitted to the director of the Distinguished Majors Program. To apply, students must have the approval of a faculty member who has agreed to direct their research. A GPA of at least 3.4 in the major and an overall GPA of at least 3.4 are required for admission. In the fall of their third or fourth year, students enroll in ARTH 4051, DMP students in the program are required to enroll in six credits of Undergraduate Thesis coursework with their faculty advisor. ARTH 4998 is taken in the Fall semester and ARTH 4999 in the Spring semester. Once capstone projects are submitted, a committee of department faculty determines degrees of distinction. This evaluation depends above all on the level of accomplishment the project has attained, considered in tandem with the students’ overall performance in the major. In the case that a project fails to meet departmental standards, a determination of no distinction may be made. The committee passes on its recommendations to the Committee on Special Programs.

In addition the Specialization requires at least one course in each of the following areas: Biological diversity: a course focused on a particular group of organisms. Environmental diversity: a course focused on a particular habitat. Techniques in conservation: a course focused on policy, statistics modeling, field methods or geo-spatial analysis. Experience in field studies: this can be fulfilled by independent study, or a summer field course at one of the University’s biological stations (Mountain Lake Biological Station, Blandy Experimental Farm), by involvement with the Africa research program in the Environmental Sciences Department, or by an internship with a conservation agency. Students who are interested in this Specialization should consult with an advisor who is a faculty of the Program in Environmental and Biological Conservation, when declaring their major. EVSC 3200 may be substituted for EVSC 2220 for students that have already taken advanced classes. Distinguished Majors Program in Biology Eligibility Applicants should have a serious commitment to research, with completion of at least one semester of Biology Independent Research (BIOL 4910/4920) and an overall grade point average of 3.400 after completion of at least three semesters of 3000-level or above Biology courses, including at least one core course (BIOL 3000, 3010 or 3020). Application to the Biology Distinguished Majors Program is made at the end of the 2nd or 3rd year. Although an overall GPA of 3.400 is required by UVA for graduation with distinction, research potential will also be a major consideration for admission to the Biology Distinguished Majors Program. Course Requirements All DMP students must complete at least two semesters of Independent Research, as well as the two semesters of the DMP Seminar in Biological Research (BIOL 4810 and 4820). B.A. students are required to complete 24 credits in upper-level Biology courses; B.S. students are required to complete 35 credit hours in upper-level Biology courses. DMP Students must attain a minimum GPA of 3.400 in all biology courses and overall in the University.

17,"Computer Science, B.A.","Computer Science, B.A. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: College of Arts & Sciences: Degree Programs The BA degree program in Computer Science provides students with a solid foundation in computer science theory and practice. An important goal of the program is give students the ability to apply computing to other disciplines in the arts and sciences (e.g., life and physical sciences, mathematics, social sciences, visual and performing arts). This idea of studying computer science in the context of a liberal arts education is what distinguishes the BA in Computer Science from computing degrees in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Graduates of this program will be prepared to apply their technical knowledge to analyze and solve computing challenges in a wide range of problem areas, including those faced by today’s computing industry. Graduates will also be prepared for graduate study in computer science and other fields that require knowledge of computer science. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the (Add school name), students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Declaring the Major and Application Process Students must have successfully completed the pre-requisites described below in order to declare the major. Due to prerequisite dependencies, it is difficult for students who have not completed CS 2100 by the end of their fifth semester to complete the major in their three remaining semesters. Ability to complete the degree in a timely manner is a factor in acceptance into the major. Second Majors: Because the goals of the degree are integrated with the study of the liberal arts, students from outside the College of Arts and Sciences who have not taken significant coursework in the College will not be allowed to declare the BA in CS degree as a second major. Students enrolled in the School of Engineernig and Applied Science are not allowed to declare the BACS as a second major. Transfer Students from Outside the University: Students transferring into the University from other institutions must apply to the department to be allowed to declare the BA in CS major. This should take place during the summer before a transfer student begins classes, and the overall process will be discussed during the summer orientation session. If an incoming transfer does not attend summer orientation, they must meet with a CS advisor before classes begin to discuss their request. Transfer students who start in the spring semester should contact the department when they begin to register for courses. Transfer students who have not completed courses equivalent to the degree’s pre-requisites described below before their first semester in residence cannot be accepted into the major until those are completed. We strongly recommend that students transferring to the University as third-years complete the equivalent of CS 2100 before coming to UVA. Due to prerequisite dependencies, it is difficult for students who do not complete CS 2100 or its equivalent by the end of their fifth semester to complete the BA in CS in the three remaining semesters.

19,"Economics, B.A.","Economics, B.A. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: College of Arts & Sciences: Degree Programs Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisites for Declaring the Major Students must complete the following prerequisites before declaring the Economics major. Complete at least two graded economics courses at the University of Virginia. Economics GPA Achieve an economics grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.3; the economics GPA is a weighted measure of all 2000 level or higher economics (ECON) courses taken at the University with the following exceptions: a. Grades received in courses taken outside the Unviersity’s Economics Department, such as transfer courses or direct credit courses offered through study abroad programs, are no included in the economics GPA. b. If a student is granted economics elective credit for a course taken in another school or department at the University of Virginia, the grade received in that course is not included in the student’s economics GPA. c. HIUS 2061 is cross-listed as ECON 2060, and HIEU 2051 was cross-listed as ECON 2050 until Spring 2015. ECON 2060 is (and ECON 2050 was) the same whether taught under history or economics numbers. A grade in HIUS 2061 (or HIEU 2051 tkaen before Spring 2015), therefore, would be included in the economics GPA. d. If a student fails and course then retakes it, both grades – the failing grade and the grade received on the retake – enter into the computation of the economics GPA. If a student has taken and passed a course, grades receive on any subsequent retake(s) are not included in the student’s economics GPA. Calculus Complete calculus through calculus I (from the courses listed below) with a minimum grade of C+ in the calculus course. MATH 1210 - A survey of Calculus I Credits: 3 MATH 1310 - Calculus I Credits: 4 APMA 1090 - Single Variable Calculus I Credits:          4 a. Students who fail to obtain a C+ on their first attempt are permitted to try to meet the prerequisite a second time. Students who twice fail to obtain a grade of at least C+ in these courses, whether in the same or different courses, are ineligible to declare the economics major.  Students considering the concentration in financial economics or graduate work in economics are encouraged to take MATH 1310 and MATH 1320 (or APMA 1110 and APMA 2120) instead of MATH 1210 and MATH 1220. b. Pre­-matriculation transfer credit or a grade of C+ or above in MATH 1220, MATH 1320, or APMA 1110 will be accepted in lieu of calculus I to fulfill the prerequisite.  However, rule 3a still applies. Students who receive a grade below C+ in Calc I and choose to take Calc II instead of repeating Calc I are using up their second chance under rule 4a above. If they receive a grade below C+ in Calc II, they are ineligible for the major. c. Students who matriculate at the University with AP or transfer credit for one of the aforementioned calculus I or II courses are exempt from this prerequisite. Transfer credit cannot be used to satisfy this requirement after one has begun taking classes at the University. Intermediate Microeconomics Complete one of the following with a minimum grade of C+ ECON 3010 - Intermediate Microeconomics Credits:          4 ECON 3110 - Mathematical Microeconomics Credits: 4 Students who fail to obtain a C+ on their first attempt at completing ECON 3010 (or ECON 3110) are permitted to retake ECON 3010 (or ECON 3110) once. Those who fail to get a grade of at least C+ in two attempts are not eligible to declare an economics major. Credit is not given for both ECON 3010 and ECON 3110, and these courses are considered the same course for the purposes of this requirement. Students who have transfer credit for ECON 3010 at the time that they matriculate at the University are exempt from this prerequisite. Transfer credit cannot be used to satisfy this requirement after one has begun taking classes at the University. Statistics Complete one of the following courses with a minimum grade of C+. STAT 2120 - Introduction to Statistical Analysis Credits: 4 STAT 3120 - Introduction to Mathematical Statistics Credits: 3 APMA 3110 - Applied Statistics and Probability Credits:          3 APMA 3120 - Statistics Credits:          3 a. Students who fail to obtain a C+ on their first attempt are permitted to try to meet the prerequisite a second time. Students who twice fail to obtain a grade of at least C+ in the statistics courses listed above, whether in the same or different courses, are ineligible to declare the economics major. b. Students who matriculate at the University with AP or transfer credit for one of the aforementioned statistics courses are exempt from this prerequisite. Transfer credit cannot be used to satisfy this requirement after one has begun taking classes at the University. NOTE: Students declaring in their 6th semester must have either completed or already registered for ECON 3720 or ECON 4720 (STAT 3220, if completed before Fall 2013, is also acceptable). Students declaring after their 6th semester must have already completed ECON 3720 or ECON 4720 (STAT 3220, if completed before Fall 2013, is also acceptable). Declaring the Major 1. Review your student record to make sure you have completed all the prerequistes - the grades must be posted on SIS. If any prerequisites are in progress, you are not yet eligble to declare. 2. Request a guide from the Undergraduate Program Coordinator in the Economics Department on how to complete the online declaration form. The coordinator is also available by email and appointment to answer questions. 3. Complete and submit the DocuSign major delcaration form (available on the Forms Directory of the College of Arts & Sciences website) per the instructions in the guide. 4. Check your Student Information System (SIS) account 5 days after submitting the form to confirm the major has been entered and that a major advisor has been assigned. If the major has not been entered, contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator in the Economics Department. NOTE: You are not declared until you have completed all four steps. Students are responsible for confirming the major has been entered into SIS. Program Requirements Students must achieve at least a 2.0 economics GPA in order to graduate. Students who finish their sixth semester with an economics GPA below 2.0 will be dropped from the major. Certain courses can be transferred towards the major after a student starts at UVA (post-matriculation), however, certain restrictions apply. For more details, please see the Transfer Credit section on the department’s website. Transfer students must meet all prerequisites. They cannot automatically declare the major. Third-year transfer students considering the economics major are strongly advised to contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator before selecting courses. No course taken credit/no credit may be used to satisfy major and concentration requirements. Students who declare their economics major after Fall 2011 must complete at least four courses in economics at the University of Virginia to graduate as economics majors, whatever transfer credit they may have received for work done elsewhere. For purposes of this rule, any class taught at the University of Virginia in another school or department of the University that is routinely accepted for major credit can be counted towards the total of four courses. Core Requirements Students must complete the following five required courses: ECON 2010 - Principles of Economics: Microeconomics Credits: 3 ECON 2020 - Principles of Economics: Macroeconomics Credits: 3 Each of the Following: ECON 3010 - Intermediate Microeconomics Credits:          4 OR ECON 3110 - Mathematical Microeconomics Credits: 4 Each of the Following: ECON 3720 - Introduction to Econometrics Credits: 4 OR ECON 4720 - Econometric Methods Credits: 3 And ECON 3020 - Intermediate Macroeconomics Credits: 3 NOTES Students entering the University with transfer credit for ECON 3010 (or 3020) on their transcript, but do not have credit for ECON 2010 (or 2020), are exempt from ECON 2010 or 2020, respectively. However, they will be required to complete one additional ECON elective; in other words, a total of 5 ECON electives must be completed for the major. Students who completed STAT 3220 before Fall 2013 may use it to meet the ECON 3720 (or 4720) requirement. Declared majors must complete ECON 2010, ECON 2020, ECON 3010 (or 3110), and ECON 3720 (or 4720) by the end of the sixth semester or they will be dropped from the major. Students wishing to declare an economics major later than the end of their sixth semester must have already completed all of these courses. Elective Courses Students must complete 4 elective economics courses, each of which must be at least 3 credit hours. At least 2 courses must be numbered 4000 or above and no more than one 2000 level elective. No economics courses numbered 1000-1999 may be used towards the economics major. Concentrations in Economics The Economics Department offers concentrations in Financial Economics, Industrial Organization, International Economics, and Public Policy. Concentrations are optional , but economics majors whose interests are heavily focused on one of the following areas may want to declare a concentration. Courses taken for a concentration are also considered major electives, unless the course is already specifically required for the major (i.e. Intermediate Microeconomics, Econometrics). Students should keep in mind that elective courses applicable to a concentration are not guaranteed to be offered on a consistent basis. Elective courses taken for a concentration may not be shared with another concentration.  In other words, the concentration must stand alone with its own set of elective courses. Concentrations must be declared in the student’s 7th term at latest. Students with questions about a concentration should contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. How to Declare a Concentration: 1. Review your transcript to make sure you have completed all the prerequisites (if any). 2. Contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. 3. The Undergraduate Program Coordinator will provide the reqirued declaration form by email. When the form has been filled out and approved via email, the Undergraduate Program Coordinator will send the completed form to your school’s registrar where it will be entered into your student record. 4. Check your Student Information System (SIS) acount 5 days after completing the form to confirm the concentration has been entered. If the concentration has not been entered, contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator in the Economics Department. NOTE: You are not declared until you have completed all four steps. Students are responsible for confirming the concentration has been entered into SIS. Concentration in Financial Economics Goals The concentration aims to provide an academic grounding in financial markets and financial decision making – to teach you how economic theory and econometric methods can be combined to analyze economic phenomena in general and in particular the core issues in financial decision-making. The finance concentration is the most technically challenging of the department’s concentrations. It requires a high level of mathematical and econometric knowledge. Students should be very comfortable applying the tools of calculus to applied problems. Students are also expected to be comfortable with computer programming. Structure The concentration is composed of two parts. Students first take a core set of economics courses as well as COMM 2010 (financial accounting). These courses provide a broad background in financial economics. These courses have long been offered in the economics department and are taught at a level accessible to all economics major. The second part is the preparation for and completion of the capstone course, ECON 4360: Empiricial Finance. The prerequisite for this course is ECON 4720: Econometric Methods. ECON 4720 is needed because ECON 4360 will rely heavily on econometric tools. Half of ECON 4360 will teach students the theoretical basis of the stochastic discount factor (SDF) methodology for pricing assets. The second part of the class will teachs tudents how to use the General Method of Moments (GMM) econometric framework for estimating and testing the validity of a variety of SDF models. Who Should Take the Financial Concentration? The concentration should be of interest to a variety of students.  Those who plan to go on to Ph.D. level work in either economics or finance, or masters level work at quantitative finance MBA programs, will benefit from the advanced financial theory and econometric tools we learn and apply.  Those who do not have plans for further post graduate study, but who are intellectually curious about finance, will find their curiosity sated.  Students heading for quantitative Wall Street jobs will benefit from studying the formal modeling and econometric methods. Notes on Coursework Completing the concentration requires that one plan in advance.  Because COMM 2010 is generally taken by pre-Commerce students, first and second year students are given priority in registering for the class.  You may find it impossible to register for COMM 2010 if you wait until your third year to take it.  ECON 4720 must be completed before starting ECON 4360.  While linear algebra is not required for the concentration, concepts of linear algebra appear (and are taught) in ECON 4720 and ECON 4360.  Students are required to complete a linear algebra course (MATH 3350 or MATH 3351 or APMA 3080) prior to attempting ECON 4720. Prerequisites for Declaring the Concentration Students must complete one course from the following list: ECON 3720 - Introduction to Econometrics Credits: 4 STAT 3120 - Introduction to Mathematical Statistics Credits: 3 STAT 3220 - Introduction to Regression Analysis Credits:          3 APMA 3110 - Applied Statistics and Probability Credits:          3 APMA 3120 - Statistics Credits:          3 Complete the following course with a grade of B or better. ECON 4720 - Econometric Methods Credits: 3 Requirements for Completing the Concentration In addition to meeting the ordinary requirements for the major, students must: Complete the Following: ECON 3030 - Money and Banking Credits: 3 Complete ONE of the Following: ECON 4340 - The Theory of Financial Markets Credits: 3 ECON 4350 - Corporate Finance Credits: 3 ECON 4365 - Global Financial Markets Credits: 3 ECON 4370 - Behavioral Finance Credits: 3 ECON 4380 - Investment Management Credits: 3 COMM 3720 - Intermediate Corporate Finance Credits: 3 Commerce and Economics Double Majors Only Student must complete the course listed below. This course cannot be taken without having met the above prerequisites for declaring the concentration. ECON 4360 - Empirical Finance Credits: 3 Students must complete the course listed below. COMM 2010 does not count as an economics elective. Economics elective courses such as ECON 3030, ECON 4340, etc., taken to meet finance concentration requirements can be counted as electives towards meeting major requirements. COMM 2010 - Introduction to Financial Accounting Credits: 3 For more information on the concentration in financial economics, contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. Concentration in Industrial Organization The industrial organization concentration has as its focus on the exercise of market power by firms and the strategic interaction between firms. Courses in the concentration use theoretical and empirical analysis to explore a wide variety of issues related to the functioning of markets and related public policies. In combination with the major requirements, the concentration prepares students for careers in business, law, and consulting. Requirements for Completing the Concentration To complete the concentration, students must meet the ordinary requirements for the major, and complete: ECON 4190 - Industrial Organization Credits: 3 Any TWO of the Following: ECON 4010 - Game Theory Credits: 3 ECON 4020 - Auction Theory and Practice Credits: 3 ECON 4110 - Competitive Strategy Credits: 3 ECON 4170 - The Economics of Risk, Uncertainty, and Information Credits: 3 ECON 4180 - Regulating Infrastructure Credits: 3 ECON 4200 - Antitrust Policy Credits:          3 ECON 4390 - The Economic Theory of Advertising Credits: 3 ECON 4195 - Empirical Industrial Organization Credits: 3 For more information on the concentration in industrial organization, contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. Concentration in International Economics The international economics concentration is designed for ambitious majors with a keen interest in global economic policy. The core course requirements, ECON 4210 and ECON 4220, develop basic literacy in empirical techniques and international economic theory in international trade and macroeconomics. The remaining course electives allow students to specialize further in economic development (ECON 4230, 4610, 4620) or area studies (ECON 3630, 3640, 4410). Many students combine the international concentration with a study abroad program or with the foreign affairs major.  Recent graduates have gone on to work for international governmental and non-governmental organizations, master’s degree programs in international studies or public policy, law school, and business school. Requirements for Completing the Concentration To complete the concentration, students must meet the ordinary requirements for the major and complete: ECON 4210 - International Trade: Theory and Policy Credits: 3 ECON 4220 - International Finance and Macroeconomics Credits: 3 Any ONE of the Following: ECON 3630 - Economics of the Middle East Credits: 3 ECON 3640 - The Economics of Africa Credits: 3 ECON 4230 - Seminar on Trade and Development Credits: 3 ECON 4610 - Economic Development Credits: 3 ECON 4620 - Seminar on Development Economics Credits: 3 ECON 4410 - Economics of the European Union Credits: 3 For double majors in economics and politics, the course listed below is also accepted as an elective for the concentration.

Concentration in Public Policy Economics is highly relevant for public policy as well as private business decisions.  Among the topics of interest in microeconomics are the wide range of effects of specific taxes, expenditure programs, and regulations.  The courses in the public policy concentration apply general theoretical models for explaining how individuals and organizations respond to changes in their circumstances to predict the qualitative effects of existing and proposed government programs, and they introduce empirical evidence on the quantitative magnitudes of these effects. The concentration also develops the abilities of its students to critically evaluate arguments for particular government actions.  It provides majors with the type of training that will enable them to compete successfully for the best junior analyst positions in governments, public policy research firms, and other organizations and for admission into the leading graduate programs in public policy.  It should also appeal to students with a strong interest in public policy who intend to pursue careers in related areas such as law. Requirements for Completing the Concentration To declare a concentration in public policy before his or her last year at the University, an economics major must have completed: ECON 3010 - Intermediate Microeconomics Credits:          4 OR ECON 3110 - Mathematical Microeconomics Credits: 4 (with a grade of B or better) AND ECON 3720 - Introduction to Econometrics Credits: 4 OR ECON 4720 - Econometric Methods Credits: 3 ECON 4310 - Economics of the Public Sector Credits: 3 To declare the concentration in the second-to-last semester at the University, a major who has satisfied the microeconomics requirement must have completed, or be enrolled in, ECON 4310. To graduate with the concentration, a major must meet the ordinary requirements for the major and complete the following: ECON 4310 - Economics of the Public Sector, Credits: 3 ECON 4880 - Seminar in Policy Analysis Credits: 3 At least two of the following courses: ECON 3040 - The Economics of Education Credits: 3 ECON 3050 - The Economics of Welfare Reform Credits: 3 ECON 3330 - Public Choice, Credits:3 ECON 3430 - Economics of Sustainability and the Environment Credits: 3 ECON 4080 - Law and Economics Credits: 3 ECON 4150 - Economics of Labor Credits: 3 ECON 4160 - Economics of Health Credits: 3 ECON 4180 - Regulating Infrastructure Credits: 3 ECON 4200 - Antitrust Policy Credits:          3 ECON 4210 - International Trade: Theory and Policy Credits: 3 ECON 4220 - International Finance and Macroeconomics Credits: 3 ECON 4230 - Seminar on Trade and Development Credits: 3 ECON 4420 - Macroeconomic Policy Credits:          3 ECON 4430 - Environmental Economics Credits: 3 ECON 4440 - Economic Inequality Credits: 3 ECON 4445 - Policy Analysis Credits: 3 ECON 4610 - Economic Development Credits: 3 Distinguished Majors Program The Distinguished Majors Program brings the best undergraduates together in their fourth year to learn from each other, enter the intellectual life of the Department of Economics, discover the anture of research in economics, and write a thesis.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisites for Declaring the Major Students may take one of two paths into the major. 1. In the recommended path, students complete one ENGL 2000-level course with a grade of C- or better. This course prepares students for upper-division departmental coursework, and also provides three hours of credit toward the major. 2. In the alternative path, a student who takes two upper-division courses in the department (3000-level or above, in literature not creative writing), with an average grade of B across those courses, may declare the major without enrolling in an ENGL 2000-level course. Program Requirements The degree in English requires ten courses (30 credits), as specified below. All courses must be at the upper-division level (numbered 3000 or above), with the exception of the single ENGL 2000-level prerequisite course. Two courses in the “History of Literatures in English” sequence: ENGL 3001 - History of Literatures in English I Credits:          3 ENGL 3002 - History of Literatures in English II Credits:          3 2. One course in literature before 1700 and one course in literature 1700-1900. 3. At least one 4000- or 5000-level seminar in literature (ENGL not ENCW or ENWR). 4. Elective courses to bring the total number of courses to ten. Most students will need five electives, including the single ENGL 2000-level course, in addition to fulfilling the requirements above. Additional Rules 1. Eight of ten courses for the major must be taken in the English department at UVA. With permission of the Director of the Undergraduate Program, up to two major electives may be taken in other departments on campus, or as transfer credit from other institutions, including semester-long study abroad programs. Courses taken outside the department may not fulfill distribution requirements. 2. As one or both of their optional “outside” courses, students may receive major elective credit for courses offered at UVA in the literature of a language other than English, taught either in that language or in translation. These courses may be taught at the 2000-level or above. Grammar and composition courses are not eligible. DUP approval is still necessary for such courses to count toward the major. 3. No more than three courses in total may fall under the writing program rubrics (ENWR and ENCW). Independent Study Only one semester of independent study, in literature or writing, may be counted toward the major. Students may apply to take an indepedent study only if they have completed four 3000- or 4000-level courses in English and they have achieved a major GPA of at least 3.30. Both classes below allow considerable flexibility, with no formal limitations on the project’s nature, as long as a faculty member is willing to direct the independent study. To request an independent study course, students (and their faculty advisors) should apply to the Director of the Undergraduate Program in the semester prior to that in which they wish to pursue their project. ENCW 4993 - Independent Project in Creative Writing Credits: 3 ENGL 4993 - Independent Study Credits: 1 to 4 Grading Standards A minimum GPA of 2.0 in major courses is required. Courses in which a student receives a grade lower than C- will not count toward the major. Concentrations in English The department offers four optional concentrations: Two are interdisciplinary in focus: Medieval and Renaissance Studies, and Modern and Global Studies. Two allow students to concentrate in the practice of creative writing: Literary Prose Writing and Poetry Writing. Each concentration modifies the English major program of study as specified below. Three of them admit students by application only; Medieval and Renaissance Studies is open to all interested. If the area program is selective, students must apply for admission in the spring semester of their second year. For current application deadlines and other questions, please contact the specific Concentration Directors indicated on the English department website. Medieval and Renaissance Studies Students in the Medieval and Renaissance Studies Concentration in English take at least 30 credits for the major. These must include: The English Major Prerequisite (one of two paths, as described above). ENGL 3002 - History of Literatures in English II Credits:          3 Students are encouraged, but not required to take the following course: ENGL 3001 - History of Literatures in English I Credits:          3 At least four other courses (12 credits) in English literature written before 1700, excluding ENGL 3001. At least two of these courses should be at the 4000 or 5000 level. Outside English Concentrators may take Medieval and Renaissance studies courses in other departments, for example, in Art History, History, Religious Studies, Philosophy, and in literatures in other languages. Consequently, in consultation with the Director of the Concentration, 3 such courses (9 credits) may be counted toward the 30 credits required of the concentrator. We strongly encourage language acquisition, especially the study of Latin. Thus, language courses taken in excess of the UVa Foreign/World Language Requirement may also be included in the up-to-9 credits students may present towards the major from outside the English Department. Here follows a partial list of courses that qualify for presentation as part of the 9-credit allowcance; students should consult the Director of the Concentration about approving others that might enhance their particular plans of study. Courses in the medieval and early modern cultures of Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Africa changes topics too often to be included here but are highly recommended. Students in the Medieval and Renaissance Concentration are encouraged to consider an independent study project with relevant faculty in order to develop specialized research ambitions and, if they are qualified, to consolidate their work by writing a thesis in the English Department’s undergraudate Distinguished Majors Program.

21,"Environmental Sciences, B.A.","Environmental Sciences, B.A. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) The Department of Environmental Sciences offers both Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Sciences (B.S.) degrees. The B.A. degree is intended for students interested in environmental sciences, environmental regulation, environmental planning, or secondary school teaching positions. Additionally, this degree can provide a strong base for entry into graduate studies in any of the environmental sciences or in other areas such as medicine, law, or business. The B.S. degree is a more course-intensive experience, excellent for students planning for graduate school or especially for professional careers in the environmental sciences. Each program has an optional thesis program that is an excellent entry into research, and it is recommended for students planning on going to graduate school. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Requirements Students must complete 30 graded credits of departmental course work with a 2.000 cumulative grade point average in major’s courses. The following are core courses: EVSC 2800 - Fundamentals of Geology Credits: 3 EVSC 3200 - Fundamentals of Ecology Credits: 3 EVSC 3300 - Atmosphere and Weather Credits: 3 EVSC 3600 - Physical Hydrology Credits: 3 The lectures and labs for any specific core class should (and, in many cases, must) be taken simultaneously. The interdisciplinary nature of the environmental science’s advanced courses is one of the program’s great strengths and unique features. To take maximum advantage of these courses, students should try to complete the four core courses by the beginning of their fourth year. Three credits of non-core 1000- or 2000-level course work, taken prior to declaring the major, may be counted toward the major. At least 11 credits of non-core courses at the 3000 level or higher must be taken. The department requires one semester of calculus and two semesters of college-level chemistry, biology, or physics with laboratories. Students should begin to to fulfill this requirement in their first year by taking: MATH 1190 - A Survey of Calculus I with Algebra Credits: 4 MATH 1210 - A survey of Calculus I Credits: 3 OR MATH 1310 - Calculus I Credits: 4 Any two of the following: CHEM 1410 - Introductory College Chemistry I Credits: 3 CHEM 1420 - Introductory College Chemistry II Credits: 3 BIOL 2100 - Introduction to Biology with Laboratory: Cell Biology & Genetics Credits: 4 BIOL 2200 - Introduction to Biology w/Laboratory: Organismal & Evolutionary Biology Credits: 4 PHYS 2010 - Principles of Physics 1 for Pre-Health Students Credits: 3 OR PHYS 1425 - Introductory Physics 1 for Engineers Credits: 3 PHYS 2020 - Principles of Physics 2 for Pre-Health Students Credits: 3 OR PHYS 2415 - Introductory Physics 2 for Engineers Credits: 3 Although not required for the degree, to do serious research and compete effectively in graduate school and employment, additional math and science is generally needed. Work in any environmental sciences area necessitates developing an understadning of related fields. Thus, to encourage each student’s success in research and the competition for top graduate schools and jobs, the department suggests students take related work based on their primary areas of interest. Ecology depends on a basic knowledge of chemistry (CHEM 1410, 1420) and biology (BIOL 2100, 2200). Geoscience, hydrology, and atmospheric science depend on chemistry and physics (PHYS 2010, 2020 or 1425, 2415) All of these areas depend on calculus (MATH 1190, 1210, 1220, 1310 1320) and the techniques of statistics: STAT 2020 - Statistics for Biologists Credits: 4 STAT 2120 - Introduction to Statistical Analysis Credits: 4 If the appropriate related work has been accomplished, students can begin the department’s core courses in the first or second year. Students are advised to obtain computer skills and an understanding of statistics as early as possible, and to take additional related sciences as their interests develop. Grading Standards Students must complete 30 graded credits of departmental course work with a 2.000 cumulative grade point average in major’s courses. Transfer Courses Once a student is enrolled at the University, transfer credits that count toward the major must be approved prior to taking the course and must be consistent with the curricular goals of the department. The department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies is responsible for overseeing the pre-approval of transfer credits. For all degree programs, students who score a 4 or 5 on the Environmental Science Advanced Placement exam will receive 3 credits for EVSC 1010. Any three credits of non-core, lower division courses, or advanced placement credit on the Environmental Science exam, may be counted toward the major if taken prior to the declaration of the majors. NOTE: Only 3 credits of non-core courses below the 3000 level may count toward the major. Requirements for Specialization in Environmental and Biological Conservation The Department of Environmental Sciences, in conjuction with the Department of Biology, offers an opportunity for students to obtain the Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Sciences with a Specialization in Environmental and Biological Conservation.

Up to three approved transfer courses may be applied toward the major.   Courses taken before matriculation transfer toward the major if they have been approved by the University and are on SIS with a History mnemonic (HIAF, HIEA, HIEU, HILA, HIME, HISA, HIST, HIUS).  Courses taken after matriculation require departmental approval.  Consult the Transfer Credit Approval Procedure link. 7.Courses taken in other departments may not be counted toward the major unless cross-listed in the History Department (e.g., ECON 2061/HIUS 2061). 8. Students must maintain a GPA of 2.0 in the major. 9. Before declaring the major, a student should have completed at least one university-level (i.e., UVa or transfer) history course with a grade of “C” or better. This course may be counted toward the ten required for the major. AP or IB courses do not satisfy this prerequisite. 10. B.A. in History with a Specialist Concentration History majors may elect to complete a thematic pathway within the major. To complete a concentration, students must complete all other requirements for the major and select five courses from the relevant list below. A student may choose only one thematic pathway. Concentrations History majors may elect to complete a thematic pathway within the major. To complete a concentration, students must complete all other requirements for the major and select five courses from the relevant list below. A student may choose only one thematic pathway. Capitalism and Economic Life The study of economic life has long been at the core of the historical profession. Modern society’s greatest triumphs, along with its ongoing trials and tribulations, can be traced to the changing forms of socio-economic organization that humans have adopted and the ideas and discourses that motivated them. This pathway explores the processes, practices, institutions, and ideologies that have shaped human economic activity across space and time. It does not limit itself to the quantitative study of the past, but takes a more holistic approach to questions of production, exchange, and consumption over the course of human history. Courses in this pathway closely examine how human practices and institutions have shaped trajectories of economic growth, but also how they sowed the seed of inequality at both the local and global level. Together, we will develop a better understanding of the multiple histories of modern capitalism, but also a sharp sense of the other forms of socio-economic organization that societies engaged in and experimented with. Over the course of the pathway, students will build an analytical toolkit that will help students understand the deep inter-relationships between economy, society and government. They will be able to engage in archival research on questions of economic life across societies and time periods. Students electing to follow this pathway must complete all of the distribution requirements for the B.A. in History and select five courses from the following list: HIXX 1501/1502: Introductory Seminar (designated topics) HIME 2003 - Markets and the Making of the Muslim World Credits:          3 HIST 2001 - Global History Credits: 3 HIUS 2061 - American Economic History Credits: 3 HIXX 3501: Introductory History Workshop (designated topics) HIAF 3051 - West African History Credits: 3 HIEU 3670 - The Fall of Communism: How the Soviet Empire Lost the Cold War Credits: 3 HIEU 3812 - Marx: As Philosopher & Social Scientist Credits:          3 HIME 3195 - Arabian Seas: Islam, Trade and Empire in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean Credits: 3 HIUS 3231 - Rise and Fall of the Slave South Credits: 3 HIUS 3232 - The South in the Twentieth Century Credits: 3 HIUS 3411 - American Business Credits: 3 HIUS 3471 - History of American Labor Credits: 3 HIUS 3753 - The History of Modern American Law Credits: 3 HIUS 3853 - From Redlined to Subprime: Race and Real Estate in the US Credits: 3 HIST 4400 - Topics in Economic History Credits: 3 HIXX 4501/4502: Seminar (designated topics) HIXX 4511/4512: Colloquium (designated topics) HIEU 5352: The British Economy Since 1850 HIME 5053: Slavery in the Middle East and Ottoman Empire HIST 5002: Global History HIUS 5022: Economic Culture in Early America Environment, Space, and Society People shape their history as they engage with the natural world and the built environment.  This pathway investigates how they move through space, understand it, and attempt to influence it. It centers on environmental history, the history of landscape and material culture, and the politics of spatial control, among other perspectives. It harnesses approaches from the study of literature, geography, philosophy, and digital humanities to generate new historical knowledge. How do people interact with the spaces around them? How do they reach out to the wider world to shape it? How do their understandings of these spaces, in turn, shape them as individuals and as members of cultures and societies?

Courses in this pathway explore the experience of civil war, international war, and one-sided mass violence in order to better understand how these have shaped and, in turn, been shaped by political, social, economic, demographic, and cultural formations throughout history. These courses also examine the relationship between violence, on the one hand, and sovereignty, state formation, communal or national belonging, citizenship, race, gender, and sexuality, on the other. Faculty teaching in this pathway address all historical eras and regions of the world from antiquity to the present.

The program consists of a two-year course of study. In the fall of their third year participants take a special colloquium on historical theory and methodology, and follow this in the spring with a Major Seminar or Major Colloquium of their choice. The fourth year is devoted to research and writing of a substantial (60 to 90 page) thesis. Distinguished majors must fulfill all the requirements of the history major. Applications for admission to the program are normally accepted in late March of each year from second-year students who have declared – or who plan to declare – history as their major. DMP students are eligible for degrees with distinction, high distinction, and highest distinction. The level of distinction is determined by the student’s GPA inside and outside the major (a minimum GPA of 3.4 is required for a degree with distinction), the quality of the DMP thesis, and overall performance in the program. For further information, contact the DMP director or the director of undergraduate studies. The American Studies Major The American Studies Major offers students the opportunity to study the United States in a multidisciplinary context. History majors focusing on the United States can also major in American Studies readily and efficiently, and this double major will deepen and enrich their study of United States history in fruitful ways. Students will be admitted to the American Studies Major after a competitive application process that is normally completed at the end of their second year. Those accepted take, in their third year, two seminars that are available only to American Studies students; a fourth-year seminar in a special topic of American Studies; and seven other courses, to be chosen in consultation with the Director of American Studies, from other departments throughout the college and the university. NOTE: History majors may count some of their coursework in United States history towards the American Studies major. For more information, please contact the Director of the American Studies Program.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Requirements The American Studies major combines interdisciplinary methods to study US culture in its regional, national, and global forms. To declare an American Studies major, students must have completed: At least one university-level (i.e. UVA or college transfer) course in American history or culture, broadly defined (including literature, music, religion, art, anthropology, etc.), with a grade of C or better. AP and IB courses do not satisfy this prerequisite. Students are encouraged to declare the major in their 2nd or 3rd year of study. Students interested in declaring should bring a College declaration form to the office hours of the American Studies Director of Undergraduate Programs or the Chair of American Studies (all hours are listed on the department website). The Director will assign an appropriate faculty advisor who will work with the student to complete a major declaration form. Declaration forms will be processed only in the Fall and Spring semesters. The American Studies major requires a minimum of 10 courses (30 credits). Distinguished Majors Program The Distinguished Majors Program provides a selected group of exceptionally qualified students the opportunity to complete original and significant research on a specific area of interest. Selection for the DMP is a process that takes into account the student’s GPA, intellectual interests, and plans for study. The deadline for submitting application material is in the spring semester of the 3rd year; the exact date will shift slightly from year to year and will be posted on the department website. In close consultation with a faculty advisor, DMP students will design a research topic for independent thesis work during their fourth year. These students must hold a cumulative minimum GPA of 3.4 to qualify for the DMP program and must maintain it to qualify for graduation with distinction. DMP students take an independent study in the fall of their fourth year with a faculty advisor. In the spring of their fourth year they must enroll in the following course with a DMP director: AMST 4999 - Distinguished Majors Thesis Seminar Credits: 3 Throughout the fourth year the DMP student will craft a critical argument, researching and writing on topics that engage in the study of American culture. DMP students demonstrate intellectual rigor and a strong work ethic. The end result is a substantive piece of scholarship, a thesis of approximately fifty pages in length. Please contact the American Studies Director or the Director of Undergraduate Programs for more information. Course Distribution Students must complete with a grade of C or better: AMST 2001 - Introduction to American Studies Credits: 3 AMST 3001 - Theories and Methods of American Studies Credits: 3 AMST 4000-level American Studies seminar, Credits: 3 7 additional elective courses (Credits: 21), which must include: 1 course on Historical Approaches, Credits: 3 1 course on Race/Ethnicity, Credits: 3 1 course on Transnational/Regional, Credits: 3 Additional Rules: At least 2 of the 7 electives must be AMST courses. At least 3 of the 7 electives must be at the 3000-level or above. The undergraduate major in American Studies provides a rigorous and diverse program of study that offers students a generous amount of intellectual range and scholarly flexibility, while still remaining rooted in a shared and coherent curricular experience. Requirements for the major include two specific courses that all majors must take. The first of these is Introduction to American Studies (AMST 2001), a 3-credit introductory lecture course that introduces students to the field, its history, and a wide variety of potential areas of study. Students are strongly encouraged to take this course either prior to or soon after declaring the major (i.e. in first or second year), or in their third year if necessary. The second required course is Theories and Methods of American Studies (AMST 3001), a 3-credit, reading-and-writing-intensive course that allows students to more thoroughly explore past and present scholarly currents and an array of theoretical and methodological approaches within the field. Additionally, all majors must take a 3-credit, 4000-level AMST capstone seminar prior to graduating. The capstone course is generally intended to be taken in Fall or Spring of the fourth year. The remainder of the major requirements consist of seven electives (21 credits in total), at least two of which must be taken under the AMST course designation, and at least three of which must be taken at the 3000 level or higher. The first stipulation ensures that students will take at least five of their ten total courses within the Department, ensuring a consistent and coherent academic experience while still providing the flexibility for interdisciplinary exploration. The second stipulation also ensures that students are taking at least five of their ten required courses in an upper-level classroom context, ensuring a suitably rigorous and intensive academic experience. Furthermore, at least three of the seven electives (9 credits) must fulfill one each of the following area requirements (students may not use the same course to fulfill more than one area requirement): Historical Approaches: These are courses that are rooted in a clearly-defined historical scope and that expose students to historical methodologies and/or archival research practices. This requirement assures that American Studies students will graduate with a firm command of the importance of historical context and a nuanced understanding of historical research and historiography. Race and Ethnicity: These are courses that are rooted in questions, topics, and issues related to the fields of critical race and ethnic studies. This requirement assures that American Studies students will graduate with a keen understanding of the ways that ideas about racial and ethnic difference and struggles for recognition and equality have shaped the United States and the American hemisphere more broadly. Transnational and Regional: These are courses that either deal with the United States’ position in relationship to international and global contexts and relations, or that deal with specific regions of the United States itself and the sets of political, social, and cultural concerns facing these regions. This requirement assures that students graduate with an understanding that the United States is far more complex, varied, and diffuse than a simple monolithic nation state, and that the borders of the nation are not the only delineation of “America.” Sample Elective Course List Historical Approaches AMST 1050 - Slavery and Its Legacies Credits: 3 AMST 2559 - New Course in American Studies Credits:

Study Abroad Shanghai Chinese Language Program: the UVA-in-Shanghai Intensive Chinese Language Program in the Department of East Asian Languages, Literatures and Cultures at the University of Virginia is hosted by Fudan University.  It is intended to enable students who are serious about studying Chinese language in a total immersion environment to cover a year’s worth of material and to earn 8 UVA credits.  This rigorous, demanding, and rewarding language program allows the student to have first-hand experience using Chinese in real world situations as well as studying and practicing it in the classroom.  For more information, use the “Find a Program” link at http://www.studyabroad.virginia.edu . UVA in Shanghai: Fudan University is offered through the partnership of University of Virginia, Fudan University, and The Education Abroad Network (TEAN). This program offers students the opportunity to spend a semester or year in Shanghai studying Chinese language for direct UVA credit, while choosing from a variety of English-taught electives for transfer credit. Students will take a Chinese Language course at Fudan University, which is offered at the Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced level. The Chinese Language program is designed and guided by DEALLC professor Hsin-hsin Liang, and students will receive direct UVA credit. Students will take non-language elective courses taught in English for transfer credit. Elective courses are available in areas such as Marketing, Economics, Management, Accounting, Finance, Sociology, Journalism, History and Political Science. Visit the Academics page on the TEAN website for course listings. Students will also have the option to participate in a part-time internship at a multinational or Chinese organization.

The Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Studies (IUP) is also a consortia program jointly administered by the 14 North American universities distinguished in Chinese studies. Established in Taipei, Taiwan in 1963, IUP has for more than a half century been the gold standard for advanced Chinese instruction, and attracts more graduate and professional school students with China-related career plans than any other language program. Located at Tsinghua University in Beijing since 1997, IUP is headquartered at the University of California at Berkeley. The University of Virginia joined the consortium in 2010. IUP is a purely language instruction program with a proficiency threshold for admission of approximately the completion of third year college-level Chinese. Students are in classes no larger than 3, with daily one-on-one sessions, and enjoy a student-teacher ratio well under 2:1. The basic program is one academic year, but qualified students may attend for the summer, fall, or spring terms only, or any combination thereof. For application, fees, schedule, and other program information, please visit http://ieas.berkeley.edu/iup/. In addition to study abroad programs administered by U.Va., students are encouraged to develop their language skills at the many other study-abroad programs that are available throughout East Asia. Please note that in order to receive transfer credit for language courses offered at such programs, students must first consult with our faculty and the International Studies Office in Minor Hall.

UVA in Shanghai: Fudan University is offered through the partnership of University of Virginia, Fudan University, and The Education Abroad Network (TEAN). This program offers students the opportunity to spend a semester or year in Shanghai studying Chinese language for direct UVA credit, while choosing from a variety of English-taught electives for transfer credit. Students will take a Chinese Language course at Fudan University, which is offered at the Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced level. The Chinese Language program is designed and guided by DEALLC professor Hsin-hsin Liang, and students will receive direct UVA credit. Students will take non-language elective courses taught in English for transfer credit. Elective courses are available in areas such as Marketing, Economics, Management, Accounting, Finance, Sociology, Journalism, History and Political Science. Visit the Academics page on the TEAN website for course listings. Students will also have the option to participate in a part-time internship at a multinational or Chinese organization.

Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies (KCJS): the University of Virginia joins Harvard, Stanford, the University of Michigan and about a dozen other Ivy Leagues in running KCJS, a well-regarded study abroad program based in Japan’s historic capital city available for one semester, an entire academic year, or the summer, or the combination of the summer and the fall.  KCJS’s summer program offers classical and advanced modern Japanese, details for which can be found on the website below.  The program requires students to have two full years of college-level Japanese language coursework as a prerequisite, and it works to improve students’ language abilities through small-group instruction tailored to each student’s ability level. Content courses on Japan in the social sciences and humanities are also offered and are typically taught in English. KCJS also facilitates daily use of the language outside the classroom by placing all students who want to take advantage of this opportunity with host families and the community. For more information on the program, application deadlines, and financial aid opportunities, please visit  www.ogp.columbia.edu. The Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Studies (IUP) is also a consortia program jointly administered by the 14 North American universities distinguished in Chinese studies. Established in Taipei, Taiwan in 1963, IUP has for more than a half century been the gold standard for advanced Chinese instruction, and attracts more graduate and professional school students with China-related career plans than any other language program. Located at Tsinghua University in Beijing since 1997, IUP is headquartered at the University of California at Berkeley. The University of Virginia joined the consortium in 2010. IUP is a purely language instruction program with a proficiency threshold for admission of approximately the completion of third year college-level Chinese. Students are in classes no larger than 3, with daily one-on-one sessions, and enjoy a student-teacher ratio well under 2:1. The basic program is one academic year, but qualified students may attend for the summer, fall, or spring terms only, or any combination thereof. For application, fees, schedule, and other program information, please visit http://ieas.berkeley.edu/iup/. In addition to study abroad programs administered by U.Va., students are encouraged to develop their language skills at the many other study-abroad programs that are available throughout East Asia. Please note that in order to receive transfer credit for language courses offered at such programs, students must first consult with our faculty and the International Studies Office in Minor Hall.

DMPs take a year-long independent study with a faculty advisor, with the goal of producing a thesis that is evaluated by outside readers. To participate in the ETP distinguished majors program, set up an appointment with Professor Lawrence during the spring semester of your third year. Credit/No Credit Grades Please note that the ETP program adheres strictly to the College of Arts and Science’s policy regarding classes taken for CR (credit) or NC (no credit). Courses counting towards the ETP area requirements and core courses may NOT be taken on a CR/NC basis. The College does not permit students to take courses on a CR/NC basis in interdisciplinary programs, nor does it permit students to count courses taken on a CR/NC basis towards a major, minor, or College area requirements. Double Majors/Minors Many ETP majors pursue double majors and minors in a variety of other subjects. Please read the requirements about double majoring and minoring set forth by the College of Arts and Sciences. Study Abroad The ETP program does not have any official positions on overseas programs. We recommend that ETP students interested in studying abroad go to other universities’ websites for ETP-like majors and see if there are recommended programs through those universities.    In the course approval process, students must go to the UVA departments for which they seek credit. For example, if you would like credit for a civil engineering class taken abroad, you must go to the Engineering Department to file for this credit. Unless it is an ETP course, we cannot approve it for credit. Additional Information For more information contact: Deborah Lawrence, Clark Hall, P.O.

High School Teaching in German For students interested in pursuing a high school teaching career, there are two options in conjunction with the School of Education and Human Development: a five-year program, in which the student may earn two degrees, a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Teaching, and a 15-month program, the post-baccalaureate Master of Teaching. For more information, contact the School of Education and Human Development. GERM 1010 and 1020 These two courses are for beginners. All students with any previous background in German who have not taken the SAT II Subject Test or the Advanced Placement test must take the German placement diagnostic (PLACE) if planning to take German at any time in their college career. The sequence of courses is: GERM 1010 - Elementary German I Credits:          4 GERM 1020 - Elementary German II Credits:          4 GERM 2010 - Intermediate German I Credits:          3 GERM 2020 - Intermediate German II Credits:          3 Once a student has placed in the required course sequence, they must complete each successive course with a passing grade. A student may not skip, for example, from GERM 1020 to GERM 2020. Students may not take more than one course in the sequence at a time. Those who place higher than course 2020 in a language and have successfully taken an advanced placement examination in that language are relieved of the foreign language requirement for the degree of Bachelor of Arts.

37,Japanese Language & Literature,"Interdisciplinary Major - Japanese Language & Literature Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Information The major in Japanese provides a distinctive combination of analytical, interpersonal, translingual and transcultural competencies that make students sophisticated and engaged global citizens able to move between languages and cultures in a thoughtful and nuanced manner. The major offers language courses from beginning to advanced levels that develop the ability to read, write, listen and speak effectively in Japanese, as well as connect students with more specialized knowledge in their individual areas of interest, giving them the skills needed to further explore such topics in their own subsequent research or self-study outside the classroom. Students also come to develop an appreciation for contemporary Japanese social and cultural values through their engagement with the language. Content courses on Japanese literature and culture in English provide thematic breadth and historical depth to this understanding by familiarizing students with texts representing more than a millennium of writings including some of the globe’s earliest and most distinguished literary works, and by honing their appreciation of the ways in which the translation and interpretations of these texts are shaped by historical, cultural, social, and linguistic forms of difference. Program Requirements 31 credits with the following distribution: EAST 1010 - East Asian Canons and Cultures Credits: 3 15 credits in JAPN courses at or above the 3000-level, 6 of these credits can come from JPTR courses at the advisor’s discretion JPTR 3010 - Survey of Traditional Japanese Literature Credits: 3 JPTR 3020 - Survey of Modern Japanese Literature Credits: 3 JAPN 4710 - Introduction to Literary Japanese (Bungo) Credits: 3 JPTR 4991 - Japanese Capstone Credits: 1 3-credit course at the 3000-level or higher taken within or outside of the department and that is not being counted elsewhere towards the major (and approved by both the Course Instructor and Major Advisor), in which the final paper uses Japanese language materials. A maximum of 15 study abroad credits and domestic transfer credits are allowed at the discretion of the student’s advisor. Students must maintain a grade of C or better in all courses that count toward the major. Students who wish to double-major are reminded that only two courses may count towards both majors. Study Abroad Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies (KCJS): the University of Virginia joins Harvard, Stanford, the University of Michigan and about a dozen other Ivy Leagues in running KCJS, a well-regarded study abroad program based in Japan’s historic capital city available for one semester, an entire academic year, or the summer, or the combination of the summer and the fall.  KCJS’s summer program offers classical and advanced modern Japanese, details for which can be found on the website below.  The program requires students to have two full years of college-level Japanese language coursework as a prerequisite, and it works to improve students’ language abilities through small-group instruction tailored to each student’s ability level. Content courses on Japan in the social sciences and humanities are also offered and are typically taught in English. KCJS also facilitates daily use of the language outside the classroom by placing all students who want to take advantage of this opportunity with host families and the community. For more information on the program, application deadlines, and financial aid opportunities, please visit  www.ogp.columbia.edu. In addition to study abroad programs administered by U.Va., students are encouraged to develop their language skills at the many other study-abroad programs that are available throughout East Asia. Please note that in order to receive transfer credit for language courses offered at such programs, students must first consult with our faculty and the International Studies Office in Minor Hall.

Taken spring semester by DMP majors. Distinguished Majors Program in Neuroscience Students with superior academic performance and serious commitment to independent research are encouraged to apply for the Distinguished Major Program (DMP) at the end of their 2 nd or 3 rd Year. In addition to the core major requirements, DMP students also take the courses listed below. The Program culminates in writing a thesis of empirical research done under the mentorship of a UVA neuroscience faculty member. The requirements for admission to the DMP are: Satisfaction of all College requirements as stated in this record with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.400 in the student’s College and university courses; A GPA of at least 3.400 in all courses taken as part of the Neuroscience major; A brief (1-2 page) project proposal along with a written endorsement of the project by a faculty member of the Neuroscience Graduate Program. To gain admission to the DMP, students submit a research proposal to the DMP Director. The names of the primary (i.e., research mentor) and secondary faculty readers must also be included. Once admitted, students register for NESC 4970 in the first semester of the fourth year. In this course, students conduct their research under the supervision of a faculty member. In the second semester, students register for NESC 4980 to finalize the thesis, ending with a journal-style manuscript. The research project is intended to foster independent thought and develop the student’s critical ability to formulate and conduct scientific research. The date of the student’s final submission of the DMP thesis to the committee is two weeks before the last day of classes. The two-member faculty committee (mentor and second reader) reports its evaluation of Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction of the thesis to the DMP Director by the first day of the exam period. The PFN undergraduate committee  then considers the thesis evaluation, along with the student’s academic record to submit a final level of distinction to the College Registrar. Students receive a letter grade for both NESC 4970 and NESC 4980. These courses do not count toward the GPA of the major.

44,Political & Social Thought,"Interdisciplinary Major - Political and Social Thought Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: College of Arts & Sciences: Departments/Programs Universal Degree Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Admission Interested students currently in their fourth semester in the College of Arts and Sciences are invited to apply for admission into this interdisciplinary program. As a distinguished major, the program admits only eighteen to twenty new students a year. A 3.20 cumulative GPA is generally required for admission; the average GPA of recent classes is well above this. The program assumes the students will be in Charlottesville their third and fourth years. It is highly desirable (but not mandatory) that students applying for the PST program should take at least one of the courses listed under the foundations of political and social thought by the end of their second year. Courses taken before admission to the major can be counted toward fulfilling its requirements. Students interested in becoming PST majors should submit: a completed PST application form (available on the PST website); an official transcript a letter of recommendation by a faculty member sent directly to Prof. Smith a 300-500 word essay. This essay should address the following questions: (1) What are your intellectual goals and why are they best addressed in the interdisciplinary PST major? (2) At this (tentative) point, what three area studies will you select in constructing your PST curriculum and why? This answer does not commit students to a particular course of studies if they are accepted into the program; but it should reflect a thoughtful and coherent curricular plan. a writing sample–preferably a previously completed and graded term paper or essay that represents one’s work at its best. a brief statement of one or two significant extracurricular activities, and why the commitment is worth the time. The above materials should be assembled in a manila file folder and placed under Professor Smith’s office door, Gibson S-396, by March 1. (Students studying abroad may submit applications online.) Candidates should hear from the committee by the end of March. The director of the PST program holds a meeting for the prospective majors in early February to answer any questions about admission procedures and program requirements. Students may also obtain this information from the PST website. Abstracts of recent PST theses are available on the website; these provide a concrete sense of how students pursue the intellectual opportunities of the program. Requirements for Major The major has four basic components: PST Seminars (8 credits) Foundation Courses (6 credits) Area Studies (18 credits) Thesis (6 credits, full year) PST Seminars - Credits: 8 Open to PST majors only, the following must be taken by the student: PST 4850 - Core Seminar in Political and Social Thought I Credits:          3 PST 4870 - Core Seminar in Political and Social Thought II Credits:          3 PST 4980 - Workshop in Thesis Research Credits:          1 PST 4989 - Workshop in Thesis Research Credits:          1 Foundation Courses Each student must complete at least six credits from the following list of courses, or equivalents approved by the director, dealing with political and social thought or its historical foundations: ANTH 3010 - Theory and History of Anthropology Credits: 3 HIEU 3782 - Origins of Modern Thought, 1580-1943 Credits: 3 HIEU 3802 - Origins of Contemporary Thought Credits: 3 PHIL 2690 - Justice, Law, and Morality Credits: 3 PHIL 3640 - Political Philosophy Credits: 3 PHIL 3710 - Ethics Credits: 3 PHIL 3720 - Contemporary Ethics Credits: 3 PLIR 3310 - Ethics and Human Rights in World Politics Credits:          3 PLPT 3010 - Ancient and Medieval Political Theory Credits:          3 PLPT 3020 - Modern Political Thought Credits:          3 PLPT 3030 - Contemporary Political Thought Credits:          3 PLPT 4200 - Feminist Political Theory Credits:          3 RELG 3650 - Systems of Theological Ethics Credits:          3 SOC 3020 - Introduction to Social Theory Credits: 3 WGS 4810 - Feminist Theory Credits:          3 Area Studies Each student is required to define three different area studies. An area is defined as a particular intellectual theme or subfield of interest to be investigated in the course of the student’s studies. These areas can be derived from within, between, or outside traditional disciplines. Some examples of area studies might include aspects of modern (or contemporary) political thought; ethical issues in modern economic development, human rights; religion in world politics; identity politics in modern social movements; state-building in third world societies; the modern welfare state; mass media and contemporary social communication; environmental justice. NOTE: An area of study is more specific than simply the name of a department or discipline. For each area, the student must complete two relevant courses, normally at the 3000 level or above. The total of six courses necessary to fulfill the area requirements must be drawn from at least three different disciplines, programs, or departments . In brief: 3 areas; 2 courses per area; 3 disciplines; Total credits:  18. Taken together, the three areas of study should be well thought-out and intellectually coherent, and form the general basis of study for the fourth-year thesis. The three areas of study define the interdisciplinary character of the student’s program and must meet a rigorous standard of coherence. In consultation with their advisors and the program director, students are expected to articulate the rationale of their choices in a brief written statement due by the end of the third year. Fourth-Year Thesis - Credits: 6 The PST thesis, of about 80-100 pages, is written over the course of the fourth year. Working with a faculty advisor, students define a topic and engage in serious research, often using primary source materials. The thesis is due on March 31, followed in late April by a full day conference at which students present their completed work. Abstracts of past theses are available on the PST website.

45,"Political Philosophy, Policy, & Law","Interdisciplinary Major - Political Philosophy, Policy, and Law Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: College of Arts & Sciences: Departments/Programs Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Information The major in Political Philosophy, Policy and Law (PPL) provides undergraduate students with an opportunity to pursue intensive study of the connections between political philosophy and legal theory, legal thought and historical change, law and public policy. The major is based firmly on the view that the study of law has a rich humanistic tradition and that its pursuit encourages sustained reflection on the fundamental values of political association. Because the domain of law, policy and political philosophy is huge, a principal objective of the major is the integration of diverse disciplinary perspectives. But interdisciplinary dialogue on political and legal ideas, processes, doctrine, and policies can be fruitful only if the participants engage one another from a position of disciplinary strength. The requirements for the major in PPL are grounded on this presumption. Students may not minor in PPL. Political Philosophy, Policy and Law is a major with three components. Majors must take: 1. three co-requisite courses 2. two required PPL courses 3. An individually tailored package of 8 courses that comprise an interdisciplinary core. Students in PPL are encouraged to combine the PPL major with majors or minors in other disciplines, but only two courses used to satisfy requirements of another major or minor may be counted toward PPL. 1. Co-requisite courses (3 Courses) Co-requisite courses must be completed by the end of students’ third year. The co-requisites are: One course in the history of political thought One course in legal history and public policy The following microeconomics course: ECON 2010 - Principles of Economics: Microeconomics Credits: 3 The first two co-requisites must be selected from the following menus: (1) History of Political Theory PHIL 2760 - Classics of Political Philosophy Credits: 3 PHIL 3640 - Political Philosophy Credits: 3 PLPT 3010 - Ancient and Medieval Political Theory Credits:          3 PLPT 3020 - Modern Political Thought Credits:          3 PLPT 3030 - Contemporary Political Thought Credits:          3 (2) Legal History and Public Policy HIUS 3752 - The History of Early American Law Credits: 3 HIUS 3753 - The History of Modern American Law Credits: 3 PLAP 3810 - Constitutional Interpretation: Separation of Powers and Federalism Credits: 3 COMM 3410 - Commercial Law I Credits: 3 NOTE: No more than one co-requisite course may count toward the fulfillment of the requirements for the Interdisciplinary Core. 2.

Distinguished Majors Program Majors in Women, Gender & Sexuality (WGS) with a strong academic record are encouraged to become Distinguished Majors. Distinguished Majors complete a two-semester written thesis (approximately 35-40 pages in length) in their fourth year under the supervision of a WGS faculty member. The thesis allows students to pursue their own interests in depth and have the intellectual satisfaction of defining and completing a sustained project. The Distinguished Major Program is an especially good option for students considering graduate level work in any field. To be eligible, students must have a 3.40 overall GPA at the start of their fourth year. Students are required to sign up for a 6-credit course, WGS 4998 and 4999, under the supervision of a WGS faculty member. The thesis must also be approved by a second faculty member whom the student will choose in consultation with the thesis advisor. The 6-credit senior thesis course will count toward the 30 credits required for the Major. Successful completion of the thesis qualifies the student for graduation with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction, depending upon the recommendation of the two faculty advisors, and subject to approval of the College’s Committee on Special Programs. An early start is important to the successful completion of a Senior Thesis. While not required, it is recommended that students make the decision to pursue the Distinguished Majors Program during their third year. This will give students the opportunity to discuss the project with various faculty members, identify suitable advisors, and have the summer between the third and fourth years to define their project further and begin some preliminary reading and planning. For these reasons, students choosing to pursue the thesis should complete a WGS DMP application form in the spring semester of their third year.

Study Abroad The Italian faculty at UVa strongly encourage all Italian Studies majors and minors to spend a term of study in Italy. For most students it is the best way to accelerate language acquisition and significantly deepen academic and cultural experience. The Italian program distinguishes between “recommended” and “approved” study abroad programs. The following two programs are recommended by Italian faculty: UVA in Siena and UVA in Florence. Both offer summer and semester-length study terms. Consult UVa’s International Study Abroad Office for an up-to-date list of approved programs. Students who wish to study in a program that is not recommended or on the approved programs list must go through the petition process run by the International Studies Office, and provide a compelling academic reason for studying in a non-approved program. Even when a study abroad program has been approved, students seeking to satisfy Italian Studies major or minor requirements must have the specific courses approved by the DUP. Students who study in a recommended program may count up to 15 credits per semester of study abroad, or 24 credits per year of study abroad toward their Italian Studies major. Students who study at an approved program in Italy may count up to 12 credits per semester of study abroad or 18 credits for a year of study abroad toward their Italian Studies major. All students wishing to earn ITAL or ITTR credit for work done abroad must have this credit approved by the Italian Studies program. Students are advised to seek more detailed information on study abroad credit transfer on the Italian program web site. Independent Study Based on faculty availability, independent study with a faculty advisor is available to advanced students of Italian who wish to pursue specific areas in depth that are not included in the regular curriculum. For an independent study course to count for the Italian Studies major it must be taken for a grade. Distinguished Major Program in Italian Italian Studies Majors of exceptional ability and dedication are encouraged to enroll in the Distinguished Major Program (DMP). This program enables qualified students to explore at a higher level their interests in Italian literature, language, and culture. Like other Italian Studies majors, DMP students are required to take ten courses (30 credits) as indicated by program requirements. In addition, DMP students in Italian must take an additional 6 credits over the course of the fourth year (3 cr Fall, 3 cr Spring), corresponding to the work they engage in researching and writing a thesis, typically ca. 30 pages in length. In the fall semester of their fourth year, DMP students enroll in ITAL 4980, the DMP Colloquium (a 3-cr credit/no credit course), meeting regularly with the DMP Coordinator to discuss research strategies and set intermediate goals. It is expected that significant work on the thesis will be completed in this semester. In the second semester of their fourth year, DMPs enroll in ITAL 4989, the Distinguished Major Thesis course (3-cr grade option). Students meet regularly with a faculty adviser to receive guidance on advanced research techniques, critical thinking skills, and effective writing strategies. The thesis is completed in this semester, and course credits depend on the successful completion of the thesis. Near the end of the spring semester DMP students present their research results to faculty, graduate students, and invited guests. The DMP will give you the opportunity to: research a topic of interest in depth over the course of a year meet with a professor on an individual basis and receive guidance on advanced research techniques, critical thinking skills, and effective writing strategies share your ideas and enthusiasm with other exceptional undergraduates in Spanish, Italian and Portuguese in a monthly colloquium present your research results to faculty, graduate students, and DMPs in the department at the end of your fourth year Eligibility: Italian Studies Majors possessing a GPA close to a 3.4 are eligible, but GPA alone will not bring automatic admission. Interest, dedication and past record will be taken into account. The last semester of the fourth year, a 3.4 cumulative GPA in all courses is an unconditional requirement in order to graduate with any level of distinction. When to Apply: Students should apply to the program in Spring semester of their third year, by the date indicated by program administrator (usually end of March, early April). Admission will be granted by the DMP Coordinator in Italian Studies. How to Apply: Students must fill out an application form plus secure a written recommendation from a departmental faculty member, and present both to the DMP Coordinator. Program Requirements: DMP Thesis After acceptance into the program (applying in the Spring semester third year), by the end of the second semester of their third year, students will refine their thesis topic in coordination with a member of the Italian Studies faculty serving as the student’s thesis director. (Students who are studying abroad in the spring semester of the third year should select their thesis topic and secure a faculty thesis advisor before the end of the summer before their fourth year.) In the first semester of the fourth year, students will take ITAL 4980, “Distinguished Majors Colloquium,” for three credits [credit/no credit], meeting periodically with the DMP Coordinator and other DMPs to develop research strategies and goals. Substantial work on the thesis will be completed in this semester. During their final semester, students will take ITAL 4989, “Distinguished Major in Italian Thesis,” for three credits [grade option] and complete work on their thesis. DMPs will present their research at a departmental colloquium in the spring of their final year. Theses will be read by the thesis director, a second reader, and the DMP Coordinator, who together will decide on levels of distinction. Details about the format of the final project should be discussed with the DMP Coordinator. A bound copy of the thesis will remain on file in the department’s Del Greco Library. Levels of Distinction: A departmental committee determines different levels of distinction (Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction), based on the quality of the student’s thesis, the student’s overall work in the major field of study, and the student’s overall college record (minimum GPA of 3.4). Distinctions, Grants and Awards The Italian program recognizes outstanding students of Italian in a variety of ways. Each spring, the program hosts its Garden Reception and Awards Ceremony, to celebrate and honor our students of Italian at both undergraduate and graduate levels. At this April gathering we award the Lola Pelliccia Undergraduate Prizes. We also present one or more of our fourth-year students with the Marie M. Giuliano Prize, for demonstrated academic excellence in Italian language study and contribution to the growth and nurturing of Italian at the University. Language Requirement ITAL 1010 is a course reserved exclusively for true beginners, students who have never studied Italian before entering UVA. Students who have studied Italian prior to coming to UVA and who wish to continue in Italian will be placed according to scores obtained on the UVA Italian placement exam. The UVA Italian placement exam is offered only twice a year, on the Monday before the Fall and Spring semesters (registration required). The sequence of courses, depending on the level at which the student begins, is as follows: ITAL 1010, 1020, 2010, 2020; or ITAL 1020, 2010, 2020; or ITAL 2010, 2020; or ITAL 2020. The sequence must be followed to complete the language requirement. Once students begin the sequence of courses, they cannot skip any course in the sequence. Students are not permitted to self-place in a language course. Students who place themselves incorrectly will receive an F for the courses in which they enroll without permission. ITAL 1010 and 2010 are offered in Fall only, and ITAL 1020 and 2020 are offered in Spring only. ITAL 2030 (Italian for Professionals) was introduced in Spring 2018 (as “Italian for Business”) and it may now count as the 4th class in the Italian Language requirement series. All Italian courses to be counted toward the language requirement must be taken at UVA or at a UVA recommended or approved study abroad program. Please note, however:  students who seek to fulfill the CLAS Foreign Language Requirement with courses taken at non-recommended abroad programs will be required to successfully pass the placement exam upon return, in order to receive foreign language requirement credit. If exam performance is not satisfactory, students must re-enter the UVA language sequence where they last left it, and may risk losing credit for the language course taken outside of UVA Additional Information For more information, contact current DUP Prof. Francesca Calamita ( f c4j@virginia.edu), 461 New Cabell Hall.

50,"Mathematics, B.A.","Mathematics, B.A. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) The study of mathematics develops logical thinking, creative problem solving, and the ability to connect ideas. This makes it highly useful and desired for diverse career paths, ranging from graduate study in mathematics, science and engineering careers, through social science, medical, and business careers. Beyond this practical aspect, studying mathematics develops appreciation for the inherent elegance and beauty of the subject and is thus a deeply rewarding endeavor. The program in mathematics offers courses of study leading to either a minor, or a major in one of several concentrations. The prerequisites to declare and the requirements to complete the major are provided below. For minor program and requirement information please visit the minor program page . The Department, of Mathematics website ( https://math.virginia.edu/ ) provides extensive further information, including background and benefits of the various concentrations, student resources, departmental procedures, and advice on navigating the program and beyond. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisite To declare the major, students must demonstrate proficiency in single and multivariable calculus at the grade level of C or better. Select one of the following options to meet this prerequisite: MATH 2310 - Calculus III Credits: 4 Note: Students may need to complete one or both of MATH 1310 -Calculus I and MATH 1320 -Calculus II prior to enrolling in Calculus III. Students should determine their appropriate starting placement in the calculus sequence by consulting with advisors and placement resources on the Department of Mathematics website. MATH 2315 - Advanced Calculus and Linear Algebra I Credits: 4 APMA 2120 - Multivariable Calculus Credits:          4 Complete a course of study at another university or program that the Director of Undergraduate Programs determines is equivalent to one of the above options. Notes: 1. The sequence MATH 1210, 1220 (Survey of Calculus I and II) is insufficient preparation for continuing to Calculus lll and should therefore not be taken by students who might want to major/minor in mathematics or any other field requiring Calculus lll or beyond. 2. The above prerequisite is not part of the major itself. Prerequisite courses do not, factor into the major GPA, are not subject to restrictions on transfer credit, double counting, or other rules pertaining to credit applied to the major. Program Requirements To complete the major, students must complete the requirements for one of the Concentra­tions or General Option below. Each concentration and the general option requires four core courses (the standard or the advanced core), and a set of required and/or elective courses. At least 6 courses offered for the major must have a MATH prefix. All classes used to complete the major must be taken for a letter grade and passed with a C or better, except that two of these may be passed with a C- or better. Restrictions & Exceptions No more than two courses taken from outside the University can be applied to the major or minor. For transfer students, more may be approved by the Director of the Undergraduate Program and transfer credit advisor. Core Requirement The core requirement consists of 4 courses, one each in differential equations, linear algebra, real analysis, and abstract algebra. The standard core is satisfied by either standard or advanced versions of these courses. The advanced core requires the advanced version for some of these courses. Standard Core Note: MATH 3315 must be passed at B- or higher to be used as a core course.

Students who have been approved for internship credit must enroll in MDST 3800 - Field Experience in Media Studies during the semester of their internship or during the semester immediately following their internship (i.e., a student interning in the summer of 2021 may enroll in MDST 3800 that summer or in Fall 2021). MDST 3800 is a 1-credit course restricted to Media Studies Majors that does not count toward the major requirements. Distinguished Majors Program in Media Studies Prerequisites and Application Students with superior academic performance are encouraged to apply for the Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) in Media Studies in which they write a thesis or complete a substantial creative portfolio with appropriate documentation demonstrating independent study of high quality. An application is required for entrance to the DMP. Students must apply in the second semester of their second year by the deadline posted on the Media Studies website. The application process is highly selective and takes into account the applicant’s GPA, application essay, as well as other factors. Once accepted, the student will be assigned a faculty advisor who will guide the student in the preparation of her or his degree plan, in the selection of courses, and who will help the student with all matters related to her or his intellectual pursuits. Prior to applying, students are expected to have complete MDST 2000: Introduction to Media Studies. Exceptions to these pre-requisites are made only at the discretion of the Director of the Media Studies Distinguished Majors Program. Requirements Media Studies DMP students are required to take the following courses: MDST 2000 - Introduction to Media Studies Credits: 3 to 4 MDST 3000 - Theory and Criticism of Media Credits: 3 MDST 3050 - History of Media Credits: 3 MDST 3504 - Topics in Global Media Credits:          3 MDST 4000 - Media Theory and Methods Credits: 3 MDST 4010 - Distinguished Majors Thesis Writing or Research Project Credits: 3 MDST 4510 - Capstone Topics Credits:          3 DMP students must also complete five (5) MDST electives at the 3000 level or above. The five (5) electives must include courses that fulfill the following criteria: One (1) Practice of Media Course from approved list (Practice of Media course list provided above). One (1) Diversity and Identity Course from approved list (Diversity and Inclusion course list provided above). * DMP students may count a second Practice of Media course as an elective. Students will choose their electives in consultation with their faculty advisor and the Director of the Media Studies DMP. These courses must constitute a plan that furthers the student’s special interest(s). In some cases, and in consultation with the faculty advisor, students may be encouraged to register for MDST 4010 both semesters of their fourth year. DMP students are expected to earn at least a 3.000 (B) in each MDST course applied to the Distinguished Majors Program and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.400 (A-) per university policy. Students who are unable to maintain these academic standards will be put on probation by the Media Studies department for one semester. Students who are not able to raise their grade point averages in the subsequent semester will be asked to leave the DMP but may continue as a Media Studies major provided they meet the minimum requirements for that major. Depending on their performance in the DMP, students are eligible to graduate with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction, and such a designation will be reflected on their diplomas.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Requirements for Major This program offers the study of music as an area in the humanities. Students develop their understanding of music through critical and comparative studies; theory and analysis; composition; and development of skills in musicianship and performance. To fulfill the requirements for a major in music, a student must complete at least 31 credits of academic course work. No course receiving a grade lower than C- will count toward major requirements. A student may not use the same course to satisfy more than one requirement. For example, a student may use MUSI 4710 (Instrumental Conducting) to satisfy either an elective requirement or the performance requirement, but not both. Though students can complete the music major in their final two years of college, it is good to begin taking major-level courses earlier. Most 3000-level MUSI courses have minimal prerequisites and thus are suitable as introductory major-level courses. Students planning careers in music should work closely with their major advisor in choosing appropriate courses for their professional goals. Professional preparation typically requires at least 12 credits of advanced departmental course work beyond the minimum major requirements. Eligible students may apply for a Performance Concentration for their third and fourth years. Successful applicants must already be taking, or be eligible to take, lessons at the 3000 level, and have a cumulative GPA of 3.0. In addition to the 31 credits required for the BA in Music, the Performance Concentration consists of an additional 21 performance credits. The Distinguished Major Project in Music allows outstanding music majors to work on large-scale projects during their last two semesters at the University, such as a recital, a thesis, a composition or some combination of these. Students take three credits of independent study each semester (these do not count towards the 31-credit Major). Students completing projects may receive the B.A. with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction in Music, provided the cumulative university GPA at graduation is 3.4 or above. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences, whether music majors or not, may apply up to 16 performance credits in music, of which 8 credits must be drawn from 3000-level courses and above, toward the 120 credits required for graduation from the College. In addition, students completing Distinguished Major Projects in Music may earn an additional 4 performance credits, potentially counting 20 credits toward graduation. I. Introductory Course Introduction to major-level study - 3 credits. MUSI 3050 - Music and Discourse Since 1900 Credits: 3 II. Four Core Courses Critical and Comparative Studies in Music – at least 6 credits.

Four Electives Electives – at least 12 credits. Four additional MUSI courses (at least 3 credits each) numbered 3000 level or above. Of these, at least one must be a seminar, that is, a 4000-level special-topic course, taught with an emphasis on reading and discussion, and in which each student accomplishes substantial original work, either in several projects through the semester or a single, large-scale project. In every case, the selection of electives must have the approval of the music advisor. Performance Concentration The Concentration in Music Performance is a credential, recorded on the transcript, recognizing significant accomplishment in musical performance by majors in the McIntire Department of Music. Admission to the Performance Concentration is by audition. The program serves students who are interested in developing their instrumental or vocal performance skills beyond the level required for the B.A. in Music. DMP students and College Arts Scholars may also earn the Performance Music majors who study with our performance faculty will be eligible to audition for this Concentration. Areas include jazz, classical music, and select genres of non-Western, popular, and folk music. The Following Courses are for Performance Concentration I-II MUPF 3950 - Performance Concentration I Credits: 2 MUPF 3960 - Performance Concentration II Credits: 2 For music majors enrolled in the Music Performance Concentration Program. Prerequisite: at least one semester of 2000-level study and a successful audition, normally to take place in the spring semester of the second year. One-hour weekly advanced lessons (13 per semester), and mandatory participation in the Performance Seminar; graded, 3 credits. Students at this level should make a time commitment to practicing appropriate to the demands of the Concentration Program, to be determined by the individual performance instructors. Students play a jury, i.e. a brief performance for a group of faculty, at the end of each semester, in addition to a 15-30-minute solo performance once per year as part of the Performance Seminar. The Following Courses are for Performance Concentration III-IV: MUPF 4950 - Performance Concentration III Credits: 2 MUPF 4960 - Performance Concentration IV Credits: 2 For music majors enrolled in the Music Performance Concentration Program. Prerequisite: MUPF 3930 and MUPF 3940. One-hour weekly advanced lessons (13 per semester); mandatory participation in the Performance Seminar. For MUPF 4960, fourth-year recital. Graded, 3 credits. Students at this level should make a time commitment to practicing appropriate to the demands of the Concentration Program, to be determined by the individual performance instructors. Students play a jury, i.e. a brief performance for a group of faculty, at the end of each semester, in addition to a 15-30-minute solo performance once per year as part of the Performance Seminar, and a spring semester full recital. Program Eligibility and Application The Concentration provides formal recognition for a few outstanding students who earn musical performance credits at an advanced level and with a coherent plan supervised by an assigned Concentration Advisor. Admission to the Concentration is based on application and audition. By the time of application (deadline announced in the spring semester), all applicants must have: Completed at least one semester of private lessons (MUPF 2xxx, Performance) Passed a successful jury to allow them to enroll in advanced lessons (MUPF 3xxx, Advanced Performance) Declared the Music Major Normally the application and audition process will take place during the spring semester of the second year, so that the students will be in the program in their third and fourth years. Certain talented students may be allowed to audition at the end of their first year in order to enter the program at the beginning of their second year. Candidates must submit an application form [link], accompanied by a written recommendation and approval to audition from their primary private lesson instructor, ensemble director, or other faculty member (an e-mail from them is sufficient). Auditions will be held in March. While audition requirements will vary according to instrument and style, the general requirement will be two or three contrasting pieces or movements from the standard solo repertoire. Consult the relevant private teacher for further details. The jury will consist of the members of the Performance Committee. Upon review of the application and successful completion of the audition, the student will be admitted to the Concentration and assigned a Concentration Advisor. Currently, admission is limited to five students per year. Program Requirements The Concentration requires students to complete the 31 credits of the existing music major, and 21 additional credits in advanced musical performance. To earn the Performance Concentration credential, students must have a cumulative GPA at graduation of 3.0 or above, and a cumulative GPA of 3.4 in all credits applied to the Performance Concentration. Distinguished Majors Program In Music The Distinguished Majors Program allows outstanding music majors to work on large-scale projects during their last two semesters at the University. The project may consist of a thesis, a composition, or the performance of a full recital; a project that combines these components is also possible. Majors normally apply to the program during their sixth semester. After a preliminary discussion with the DUP, a student arranges supervision by a main advisor and another other committee member, and submits a proposal to the DUP. Each spring, the DUP announces detailed application procedures and a deadline. Work on the Distinguished Majors project normally takes place through three credits of independent work in the last two semesters at the University. These credits do not count toward music major requirements. A student working on a thesis or composition normally takes the following course at 3 credits each: MUSI 4993 - Independent Study Credits: 1 to 3 A student preparing a recital normally takes honors-level private performance lessons at 2 credits each, such as the following courses: MUPF 4930 - Honors Performance Credits: 2 Students preparing a recital typically take an academic independent study, at one or more credits each, pertinent to the recital program: MUPF 4940 - Honors Performance Credits: 2 Projects are due, at the latest, by the last day of classes in the second semester of work; a student’s committee may set an earlier date of completion. The committee evaluates the completed project and submits a report to the full-time faculty. Students completing projects may receive the B.A. with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction in Music, provided the cumulative GPA at graduation is 3.4 or above (a CLAS rule). Any level of distinction is an unusual honor, showing strong Department admiration for a student’s work. The Department awards Highest Distinction only rarely.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisite for Major Students must have passed at least one philosophy course (a course with the PHIL mnemonic) with a grade of C or better before declaring the philosophy major.  The only exception to this policy shall be the following: if a student is currently enrolled in a philosophy course the DUP, in consultation with the instructor of said course, may allow a student to declare the major. Requirements for Major The philosophy major requires a total of 30 credits of courses numbered 2000 or higher.  Students who double major may count any six credits from their second major towards the philosophy major.   These 30 credits must include one course satisfying each of the following requirements: A. Metaphysics and Epistemology (one of the following classes) PHIL 3310 - Metaphysics Credits: 3 PHIL 3320 - Epistemology Credits: 3 PHIL 3330 - Philosophy of Mind Credits: 3 B. Logic (one of the following classes) PHIL 1410 - Forms of Reasoning Credits: 3 NB:  PHIL 1410 fulfills the logic requirement but does not count in the 30 credits for the major PHIL 2420 - Introduction to Symbolic Logic Credits: 3 PHIL 5420 - Symbolic Logic Credits: 3 C. Ethics (one of the following classes) PHIL 3640 - Political Philosophy Credits: 3 PHIL 3710 - Ethics Credits: 3 PHIL 3720 - Contemporary Ethics Credits: 3 PHIL 3730 - Ancient Ethical Theory Credits: 3 D.

Students who incur a C- in a Philosophy course are placed on probation as majors for the following semester. Further, students whose cumulative GPA in major courses falls below 2.0 will also be placed on probation for the following semester. Absent significant improvement in their academic performance, these students may be discontinued as a major in Philosophy. The Distinguished Majors Program in Philosophy The Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) is designed for students who wish to pursue their studies in philosophy beyond the requirements of the regular major. It requires both the study of a broad range of philosophical areas and a more concentrated examination of a single topic in the form of a senior thesis. DMP students must complete 36 credits of course work in philosophy, no more than 12 of which are at the 2000-level. Courses at the 1000-level cannot be counted towards DMP requirements. The area requirements for the DMP are the same as for the major, except that: (i) the logic requirement must be fulfilled by taking PHIL 2420 or 5420 and (ii) Distinguished Majors must take a Seminar for Majors (PHIL 4010, 4020, or other designated course.) In addition, six of the required 36 credits must be used for the thesis and allocated as follows: PHIL 4993 (Directed Readings) to be used as a pre-thesis research course and PHIL 4999 (Senior Thesis). (The Seminar for Majors and PHIL 4993 will satisfy the college DMP requirement for 6 credits of advanced course work.) Depending on program performance, Distinguished Majors will graduate with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction. Students normally apply to the DMP at the end of their third year. Students applying at this time must have completed at least six philosophy courses, and must have and maintain a GPA of at least 3.4 in all philosophy courses taken. In addition, they should have an overall GPA close enough to 3.4 to make it likely that they will be able to satisfy the College requirement of a final cumulative GPA of 3.4 for graduation with distinction. Application materials: (i) a brief proposal of a thesis topic; (ii) an up-to-date transcript; (iii) a note from a faculty member indicating that he or she is willing to supervise the applicant’s thesis; (iv) a writing sample. The Philosophy Minor The requirements for the Philosophy Minor are 15 credits of philosophy courses. No more than three credits may be below the 2000 level. The program of study should be developed in consultation with a departmental advisor.

Group 1: MATH 2310 - Calculus III Credits: 4 PHYS 1420 - Introductory Physics 1: Classical Mechanics, Waves, and Thermodynamics Credits: 3 PHYS 1429 - Introductory Physics 1 Workshop Credits: 1 PHYS 2410 - Introductory Physics 2: Electricity, Magnetism and Optics Credits: 3 PHYS 2419 - Introductory Physics 2 Workshop Credits: 1 Group 2: MATH 3250 - Ordinary Differential Equations Credits: 4 PHYS 2620 - Modern Physics Credits: 4 PHYS 2720 - Problem Solving and Special Topics in Classical Physics Credits: 2 Group 3: Four 3000-level Physics elective courses The classification of the courses into components reflects the order in which classes are taken. Physics courses are more sequential than courses in some other majors. Course descriptions in SIS, or at the department webpage, list other courses that are expected to be taken earlier, or concurrently. Students can substitute APMA 2120 (Multivariable Calculus) for MATH 2310 (Calculus III), APMA 2130 (Applied Differential Equations) for MATH 3250 (Ordinary Differential Equations), PHYS 1425 (Introductory Physics 1 for Engineers) for PHYS 1420 (Introductory Physics 1), and PHYS 2415 (Introductory Physics 2 for Engineers) for PHYS 2410 (Introductory Physics 2). The elective courses PHYS 3110 (Widely Applied Physics), PHYS 3120 (Applied Physics: Energy), and PHYS 3140 (Intermediate Lab) can be used to complete a strong preparation in applied physics. These courses are designed to make use of the concepts learned in the introductory courses to understand some modern applications with a focus on energy production and use. PHYS 3630 (Computational Physics) is another good choice for students interested in computation, or PHYS 3040 (Physics of the Human Body) for students with interest in biology or medicine. Students completing the B.A. program have an outstanding record of success in admission to medical, law, business, and education schools.

Distinguished Majors Program The Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) in Religious Studies affords qualified students the opportunity to do advanced research and to receive at graduation the honor of distinction, high distinction, or highest distinction. Entry into the program Students qualify for application to the program if they have achieved an average GPA of 3.400 in all course work prior to application to the program. Students must apply to the DMP program by April 1 of their Third Year (or equivalent). To do this, students will be asked to write a few short paragraphs in which they explain why they are interested in the program and to outline two or three topics on which they would be interested in writing. A form explaining the application essay in more detail will be available on the Religious Studies website. The applicant must obtain endorsement from a Religious Studies faculty member to apply to the program. Unless otherwise arranged, this faculty member will serve as the student’s thesis advisor. Students should contact the Religious Studies Director of Undergraduate Programs (DUP) if they need help identifying faculty members for endorsement. By the end of the first semester of the thesis-writing year, the student must obtain a second reader for the thesis from the Department as well. The DUP can also help students find a second reader if they are unable to do so on their own. DMP Requirements Completion of normal major requirements. In addition to the 30 credits required for the major, students must take the following courses. RELG 4800 - Crafting a Research Project in Religious Studies Credits:          3 Note: In RELG 4800 students write a thesis proposal outlining the thesis’s driving questions, its methods and its sources. Students also write an annotated bibliography of works relevant to the thesis. RELG 4900 - Distinguished Major Thesis Credits:          3 Note: RELG 4900 is an independent study in which each student works with a faculty advisor to write the Distinguished Majors Thesis. The thesis should be thirty to fifty pages in length. Final copies must be submitted to the faculty advisor and the second reader no later than May 1st for Spring graduation and August graduation, and December 1st for December graduation. A final copy must also be submitted to the department archives by sending it to the DUP.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Requirements for Major The department offers two concentrations: Both concentrations require courses beyond the following: RUSS 2020 - Second-Year Russian Credits:          4 Both concentrations require the following courses to be taken beyond RUSS 2020: RUSS 3010 - Third-Year Russian Credits:          3 RUSS 3020 - Third-Year Russian Credits:          3 In addition to RUSS 2020, 3010, and 3020, students must complete the following for the Russian Language and Literature concentration: RUTR 3350 - Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature Credits:          3 OR RUTR 3360 - Twentieth Century Russian Literature Credits:          3 Additional twelve credits planned in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students must complete the following for the Russian and East European Studies concentration with thirty credits beyond RUSS 2020: These 30 credits include 6 credits of language study (RUSS 3010-3020 or 6 credits of another Slavic language, e.g., Polish RUTR 2460 - Introduction to Russian Culture and Civilization Credits:          3 PLCP 3210 - Russian Politics Credits:          3 HIEU 2152 - History of the Russian Empire 1700-1917 Credits: 3 OR HIEU 2162 - History of Russia Since 1917 Credits: 3 A course in Russian and/or Slavic folklore Three additional courses planned in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies NOTE: No more than 18 of the 30 credits (i.e., 6 of the 10 courses) may be in one department. RUTR courses offered simultaneously at the 2000 and 3000 level must be taken at the 3000 level by majors. Grading Standards: Students in the major must maintain a satisfactory grade point in major-related courses each semester. Satisfactory is defined as an average of C (i.e., 2.000), with no grade below C-. Students not maintaining this grade point are subject to discontinuation from the major. Requirements for Minor The department offers two minor programs: Russian Language, Literature, and Culture: seven courses planned in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies of at least three credits each beyond RUSS 1020 in Russian language, literature, culture and folklore. Russian and East European Studies: seven courses planned in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies of at least three credits each beyond RUSS 1020 in Russian language, literature, culture, folklore, government, history, etc., with no more than three courses in any one department. The three-course restriction does not include RUSS 2010 and 2020; therefore, as many as 5 of the 7 courses may be taken in Slavic Languages and Literatures should the student choose to take RUSS 2010 and 2020. Distinguished Majors Program Students with superior academic performance (GPA 3.500 or above in the major and 3.400 overall) are encouraged to apply to the department for admission to the Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) in Russian Language, Russian Literature, or Russian and East European Studies. This program offers the exceptional student the opportunity for more rigorous and specialized work, including independent study, participation in upper-level courses, and the preparation of a senior honors thesis. Students are normally admitted to the DMP at the end of their third year of study. See the Director of Undergraduate Studies for requirements. College Language Requirement The language requirement of the College of Arts and Sciences may be satisfied in Russian by successfully completing RUSS 2020, or by presenting evidence of equivalent preparation. Any incoming student or student returning from study abroad, or study at another institution, who wishes to continue Russian must take a placement test.

59,"Sociology, B.A.","Sociology, B.A. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: College of Arts & Sciences: Degree Programs Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisites for Declaring the Major Before declaring a major in Sociology, a student must first complete two courses (six credits) in Sociology, with a grade of “C” or better in each course. SOC 1010 - Introductory Sociology Credits: 3 SOC 3020 - Introduction to Social Theory Credits: 3 OR SOC 3120 - Sociology Research Workshop Credits: 4 (may be used to fulfill the prerequisite requirements) NOTE: Third-year transfer students may declare a major in Sociology if they have completed two Sociology courses at their previous institution, with a grade of “C” or better in each course. Requirements for Major Four core courses are required of all sociology majors as part of the thirty credit program and are expected to be completed by the end of the third year. They are: SOC 1010 - Introductory Sociology Credits: 3 SOC 3020 - Introduction to Social Theory Credits: 3 SOC 3120 - Sociology Research Workshop Credits: 4 SOC 3120 should be taken in the fall of the third year SOC 3130 - Introduction to Social Statistics Credits: 4 NOTE: SOC 3120 is a prerequisite for SOC 3130. Majors must also complete six elective courses (18 credits). Two of these elective courses must be at the 2000 level. Four of these elective courses (12 credits) must be at the 3000 level or above, including two courses (6 credits) at the 4000 or 5000 level. Students should note that all 4000- and 5000-level courses require at least two prior Sociology courses (6 credits) as prerequisites. NOTE: Courses in the Distinguished Majors Program do not count toward the elective requirements. Only 3 credits of the following course may be included in the thirty-hour major requirements: SOC 4970 - Special Studies in Sociology Credits: 1 to 6 A grade of “C” or better is necessary in every course to be counted toward the major. Students receiving less than a “C” in one of the four required courses must retake the course and receive a grade of “C” or better. Students receiving less than a “C” in an elective course will be required to take another Sociology course for the major. (Elective courses where a student receives an unsatisfactory but passing grade still count toward the College’s requirement of 120 credits for graduation even though they do not count toward the major. Because the College will not give credit for taking a course twice, re-taken required Sociology courses do not count toward the 120- credit requirement.) Students are required to maintain a GPA of 2.0 or higher in Sociology courses. In addition, students may not receive grades of “C minus” or lower in three or more Sociology courses. Students who fail to meet these requirements are required to petition the Director of Undergraduate Programs for permission to remain in the major. Any such petition must include both (a) an explanation of what occurred and (b) a plan for avoiding further low grades in the future. Students who do not submit a satisfactory petition will be dropped from the major With approval of the Undergraduate Studies Committee, up to six credits (2 courses) of course work in related fields may be used to fulfill the thirty-credit requirement as elective credit (any level). These two courses should fulfill a concentration or study objective and should be completed with a “C” or better. Only sociology courses can be used to satisfy the course requirements at the 4000 or 5000 levels. NOTE: J-Term courses do not count toward the major. Exemptions and Waivers Exemption from SOC 1010 Transfer students who have transferred credits for a course in Introductory Sociology taken at another institution prior to matriculation at the University are exempt from the requirement to take SOC 1010. However, the Introductory Sociology course taken at the previous institution does not count toward the 30 credits required for the completion of the sociology major. Thus transfer students must take an additional Sociology course at any level. Exemption from SOC 3130 Students may be exempted from the requirement to take SOC 3130 - Introduction to Social Statistics, if one of the following circumstances applies: The student has completed the following two courses with a “C” or better and either (a) is double-majoring in Psychology or (b) completed those courses prior to declaring a major in sociology. PSYC 2005 - Research Methods and Data Analysis I Credits:          3 PSYC 3006 - Research Methods and Data Analysis II Credits:          4 The student has completed ECON 3710 with a “C” or better and either (a) is double-majoring in Economics or (b) completed that course prior to declaring a major in sociology. The student has completed one of the following courses and either (a) is double-majoring in Statistics or (b) completed that course prior to declaring a major in sociology. STAT 2020 - Statistics for Biologists Credits: 4 STAT 2120 - Introduction to Statistical Analysis Credits: 4 STAT 3120 - Introduction to Mathematical Statistics Credits: 3 Exemption from SOC 3130 does not reduce the total 30 credits required for completion of the major. Thus, exempted students must complete an additional Sociology course at any level. NOTE: Students in unusual circumstances may petition the DUP and the Undergraduate Studies Committee for an exemption from a requirement or a waiver of any departmental policy relating to the major. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that the Committee has all appropriate materials. Deferring the Declaration of Major: Before declaring a major in sociology, a student must first complete the prerequisite courses.  (See the section above on “Requirements for the Major” for details.). Students entering their fifth semester who have not completed the prerequisites to declaring the major must defer their declaration for one semester while they complete the prerequisites.  The Declaration of Major Deferral Form is available from the College website ( https://college.as.virginia.edu/forms ).  On the form, list the Director of Undergraduate Programs as your “major contact” in the Department.  You should also contact the Department’s Academic Assistant, Ms. Joyce Holleran, to let her know you plan to submit the deferral form.  Otherwise, if you submit the form incorrectly, the Department may not know about it. Concentrations The Department offers three concentrations as options for sociology majors: “Crime, Law and Power” and “Global Economy, Organizations and Work,” and “Health and Medicine.” Although a concentration is not required, students with an interest in one of these areas may find it valuable. A concentration enables students to pursue a coherent course of study focused on a particular theme and guides them in selecting the courses that allow for an in-depth exploration of that topic. Moreover, because concentrations are noted on students’ transcripts, they signal a specific course of study to graduate programs and employers. Each concentration requires the completion of three courses (9 credits) focused on relevant topics. No more than one course (3 credits) taken outside the Department may be counted toward a concentration. To be counted toward a concentration, a course taken outside the Department must also count toward the major. Crime, Law and Power The Crime, Law and Power concentration may be of interest to students planning careers in law, criminal justice, politics, government, and related non-profit agencies. It provides students with a rigorous study of social theory and research to aid them in developing an understanding of crime and violence, law and the legal system, and legal and non-legal modes of exercising power in society. This concentration requires the completion of three  courses (9 credits) focused on issues in crime. criminology, justice, law and the legal system, or power and authority. Students may use courses from the pre- approved list below, or may request the use of a course not listed. Any courses not on the pre-approved list, including cross-listed courses, which a student might wish to have count towards the concentration, must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Programs. The request can be shown on the Declaration Form or communicated separately, in writing, to the Director of Undergraduate Programs. Pre-Approved List SOC 2230 - Criminology Credits: 3 SOC 4054 - Political Sociology Credits: 3 SOC 4055 - Law, Inequality and Social Change Credits:          3 SOC 4230 - Deviance and Social Control Credits: 3 SOC 4260 - Race, Crime and Punishment Credits: 3 SOC 4660 - Sociology of Power and Authority Credits: 3 The Department will also include a current list of other relevant Arts and Sciences courses in the annually updated Undergraduate Handbook. Global Economy, Organizations and Work Requirements The Global Economy, Organizations, and Work concentration may be of interest to students planning careers in business, government, law, human resources, and market research. It provides students with the opportunity to study the economic sphere of social life from within the liberal arts and sciences, utilizing a social-science point of view. This concentration requires the completion of three courses (9 credits) focused on issues in Global Economy, Organizations and Work by selecting at least three of the six electives allowed in the Sociology major from a list of approved courses that address markets, money, consumption, development, organizations, work and other topics in economic sociology. Students may use courses from the pre-approved list below, or may request the use of a course not listed. Any courses not on the pre-approved list, including cross-listed courses, which a student might wish to have count towards the concentration, must be approved by the Director of the Undergraduate Programs. The request can be shown on the Declaration Form or communicated separately, in writing, to the Director of Undergraduate Programs.

Students may use courses from the preapproved list below or may request the use of a course not listed. Any courses not on the preapproved list, including cross-listed courses, which a student might wish to have count towards the concentration, must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Programs.

The Distinguished Majors Programs The Department of Sociology participates in the College’s Distinguished Majors Program (DMP). The DMP provides qualified and motivated students with the opportunity to design and carry out an original research project under the supervision of a faculty member over the course of two semesters. This effort culminates in writing an honors thesis. Eligibility for Admission to the Program • Students wishing to join the Program should have a cumulative GPA of 3.4 or higher. Students with a slightly lower GPA may be admitted, with the expectation that grades will be raised by the time of graduation (see the section on “Levels of Distinction” below). • Students must have completed SOC 3120-Sociology Research Workshop before enrolling in the Program. The Application Process Applications to the DMP should be submitted in the Spring semester of the student’s third year for participation during the fourth year. In unusual circumstances, a student may request to apply in the Fall of the third year for participation during the Spring of the third year and the Fall of the fourth year. Students who are interested in this option should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Programs. Requirements Participation in the Distinguished Majors Program requires the completion of two additional courses (six credits) beyond the 10 courses normally required for major. In the first semester of the Program, normally the Fall semester of the fourth year, students must register for SOC 4980, Distinguished Majors Thesis Research. In this course, students formulate a clear research question, design their research, prepare a detailed research proposal or thesis draft, and begin data collection. If the number of Distinguished Majors is sufficient, the 9 Department will offer a weekly Distinguished Majors seminar taught by the DUP or another faculty member. In any case, students will meet regularly with their faculty advisors. In the second semester of the Program, normally the Spring semester of the fourth year, students must register for SOC 4981, Distinguished Majors Thesis Writing. In this course, students complete data collection and analysis and write a finished thesis under the supervision of their faculty advisors. The thesis will be jointly graded by the student’s faculty advisor and a member of the Undergraduate Committee. Levels of Distinction Students who successfully complete the requirements of the DMP may receive their degrees with distinction. There are three levels of honors: distinction, high distinction, and highest distinction. The level of distinction awarded depends on: (1) the grade for the thesis, (2) overall performance in the Sociology major, and (3) overall College record. The College of Arts and Sciences requires that students completing a Distinguished Majors Program earn an overall College GPA of 3.4 or higher. Importantly, the College does not round GPAs. Any student who completes the thesis but does not have an overall GPA of 3.4 or higher will receive credit for SOC 4980 and SOC 4981, but will not be able to graduate with distinction. Requirements for Minor Academic Requirements Students must complete the following course with a grade of “C” or higher: SOC 1010 - Introductory Sociology Credits: 3 Introduces the fundamental concepts and principles of sociology and the major subfields of the discipline. Elective Courses Minors must also complete two elective courses (6 credits) at the 4000 or 5000 level. The remaining three elective courses (9 credits) can be taken at any level. Grade Requirements All courses used to meet the 18- credit requirement must be letter-graded.   Courses taken on a Credit/No Credit or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis do not count toward the major. A grade of “C” or better is necessary in every course to be counted toward the minor. Students receiving less than a “C” in SOC 1010-Introductory Sociology must retake the course and receive a grade of “C” or better.  Students receiving less than a “C” in an elective course will be required to take another Sociology course to complete the minor.  (Elective courses where a student receives an unsatisfactory but passing grade still count toward the College’s requirement of 120 credits for graduation even though they do not count toward the major. Because the College will not give credit for taking a course twice, if SOC 1010 is re-taken, the second time will not count toward the 120-credit requirement.) In addition, students are required to maintain a GPA of 2.0 or higher in Sociology.  Students who fail to do so will be dropped from the minor. Exemptions and Waivers Exemption from SOC 1010 Transfer students who have transferred credits for a course in Introductory Sociology taken at another institution prior to matriculation at the University are exempt from the requirement to take SOC 1010-Introductory Sociology.  However, the Introductory Sociology course taken at the previous institution does not count toward the 18 credits required for the completion of the sociology minor. Thus transfer students must take an additional sociology course at any level. Other Exemptions and Waivers Students in unusual circumstances may petition the DUP and the Undergraduate Studies Committee for an exemption from a requirement or a waiver of any departmental policy relating to the minor. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that the Committee has all appropriate materials. Prizes The Department annually awards two undergraduate prizes: The Commonwealth Prize for the Best Undergraduate Paper in a Sociology course, and the Prize for the Outstanding Distinguished Majors Thesis.  Faculty members nominate student papers for these awards. Facilities The department is located at Randall Hall 101, 130 Ruppel Drive, Charlottesville VA 22904. Research In addition to encouraging independent student projects, the department has occasional opportunities for students to work as paid assistants on faculty research projects. Inquiries should be addressed to the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

60,"Spanish, B.A.","Spanish, B.A. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: College of Arts & Sciences: Departments/Programs Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisites In order to declare a major in Spanish, a student must have completed SPAN 2020 Advanced Intermediate Spanish or the equivalent, with a grade of C or better. A C- is insufficient. Students must complete SPAN 2020 at the University of Virginia or through a study abroad program recommended, not merely approved, by the department. Students who have scored a 4 on the Spanish Language Advanced Placement (AP) Exam will proceed directly to SPAN 3010. Students who have scored a 5 on the Spanish Language AP Exam may not take SPAN 3010 for credit; they are eligible to enroll in any SPAN class for which 3010 is the sole prerequisite. Students who score a 4 on the Spanish AP Literature Exam will proceed directly to SPAN 3300. Students who have scored a 5 on the Spanish AP Literature Exam may not take 3010 or 3300 for credit; they should proceed to any course for which Span 3010 or 3300 is a prerequisite. Students who have earned a score of 5, 6, or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) Spanish Exam A1 or A2 may enroll in SPAN 3300. They may not take SPAN 3010 for credit. Students who have scored a 5 or 6 on the IB Spanish Exam B (High Level) should enroll in SPAN 2020. Students who have scored a 7 on the IB Spanish Exam B (High Level) should enroll in SPAN 3010. Native speakers of Spanish must consult the Director of the Undergraduate Program before taking any Spanish courses in order to determine how best to proceed. Heritage speakers will need to be assessed via SAT II, AP, or AVANT placement exam scores, but are welcome to consult with the Director of Undergraduate Program as well. Spanish Requirements for the Major in Spanish The Spanish major consists of thirty credits completed above the following course with a grade of C or better: SPAN 2020 - Advanced Intermediate Spanish Credits:          3 NOTE: Courses in which a student receives a C- or less will not count toward the major. As in the case of any major in the College of Arts and Sciences only courses taken for a grade will count for the major. Additionally, only courses taught in Spanish and with the “SPAN” prefix can count toward the Spanish major. When declaring the Spanish major, all students are required to choose one of the three concentrations described below ( the General Concentration, the Literature and Culture Concentration, and the Language and Linguistics Concentration ) to give structure to their Spanish studies. Students are expected to take courses in the sequence indicated below for each concentration. ​ The Spanish major consists of 10 different courses (30 credits). Spanish majors may not take a survey course (3400-3430) during their fourth year, unless: They are on the Language and Linguistics track OR They began upper level Spanish study late enough that it would have been impossible to have taken the survey course any earlier. Students who are placed out of the following courses must still earn 30 credits of upper-division Spanish to complete the major, substituting another language course for SPAN 3010 and another literature course for SPAN 3300: SPAN 3010 - Finding your Voice in Spanish Credits:          3 AND/OR SPAN 3300 - Texts and Interpretation Credits: 3 NOTE: A survey of literature and culture course (SPAN 3400-3430) may substitute for 3300 as long as it is not used to count as one of the required surveys. Students who place out of SPAN 3010 and/or 3300 must provide the department with proof of placement (e.g. copy of AP scores). Information for Native and Heritage Speakers: All students who place themselves incorrectly may lose credit for the courses in which they enroll without departmental permission. Only one conversation course may be counted toward the major. Native speakers of Spanish may not enroll in conversation courses. Heritage speakers must consult with the Director of Undergraduate Programs for permission to enroll in a conversation course. It is expected, but not required, that all Spanish majors will complete at least a summer of study-abroad. All are highly encouraged to study abroad for a semester or a year. Credit will only be granted for study completed at a program approved by the department for major or minor credit. A list of these programs is available on the department website. NOTE: Students who wish to study in a program that does not appear on the department’s list must go through the petition process administered by the International Studies Office and must also apply to the Director of Undergraduate Programs in Spanish. They must provide a compelling academic reason for studying in a non-approved program. Students who study in a UVA program (currently, only the program in Valencia provides 2000-4000 level courses) may count all of the courses taken abroad toward their Spanish major or minor. Students who study in an approved program in Spain or Latin America that is not run by UVA may count up to 9 credits for a semester of study abroad or 15 credits for a year of study abroad toward their Spanish major. Two non-consecutive semesters of study abroad will be treated as a continuous year abroad for the purpose of transferring credit toward the major or minor, as will any combination of a semester abroad with a summer term. Concentration in General Spanish One prerequisite and 10 additional courses. Prerequisite: SPAN 2020 - Advanced Intermediate Spanish Credits:          3 ( or equivalent ) (Must be completed before declaring the major) SPAN 3010 - Finding your Voice in Spanish Credits:          3 SPAN 3300 - Texts and Interpretation Credits: 3 One Survey of Spanish Literature and Culture: SPAN 3400 - Spain: From Kingdom to Empire (1200 - 1700) Credits:          3 or SPAN 3410 - Perspectives on Modern Spain (1800 to the Present) Credits:          3 One Survey of Latin American Literature and Culture: SPAN 3420 - Politics and Power in the Early Americas (1492 - 1800) Credits:          3 or SPAN 3430 - Contemporary Latin American Voices (1800 to the present) Credits:          3 One Language or Linguistics Course From the Following Options: SPAN 3000 - Phonetics: The Sounds of Spanish Credits:          3 SPAN 3020 - Elevate your Spanish: Mastering Writing and Grammar Credits:          3 SPAN 3030 - Cultural Conversations Credits: 3 SPAN 3031 - Conversation Cinema: Latin America Credits: 3 SPAN 3032 - Conversation Cinema - Spain Credits: 3 SPAN 3040 - Business Spanish Credits:          3 SPAN 3050 - Spanish for Medical Professionals Credits: 3 SPAN 3200 - Introduction to Hispanic Linguistics Credits:          3 SPAN 4040 - Translation from Spanish to English Credits:          3 SPAN 4050 - Economy of Latin America Credits: 3 SPAN 4200 - The Origin of Spanish and its Transformation Credits:          3 SPAN 4201 - Hispanic Dialectology and Bilingualism Credits: 3 SPAN 4202 - The Spanish Language and its Societies Credits:          3 SPAN 4203 - Foundational Structures of Spanish Credits:          3 SPAN 4210 - Historical Panorama of the Spanish Language II Credits:          3 SPAN 4220 - Linguistic Theories of Writing: The Advanced Language Learner Credits: 3 SPAN 4530 - Special Topics Seminar: Language Credits:          3 One Linguistics Course From the Following Options: SPAN 3000 - Phonetics: The Sounds of Spanish Credits:          3 SPAN 3200 - Introduction to Hispanic Linguistics Credits:          3 SPAN 4200 - The Origin of Spanish and its Transformation Credits:          3 SPAN 4201 - Hispanic Dialectology and Bilingualism Credits: 3 SPAN 4202 - The Spanish Language and its Societies Credits:          3 SPAN 4203 - Foundational Structures of Spanish Credits:          3 SPAN 4210 - Historical Panorama of the Spanish Language II Credits:          3 SPAN 4220 - Linguistic Theories of Writing: The Advanced Language Learner Credits: 3 SPAN 4530 - Special Topics Seminar: Language Credits:          3 Four courses at the 4000-level: SPAN 4040 may count as a literature and culture or as a language course. SPAN 3010 must be taken at the University of Virginia, the U.Va. program in Valencia, or through an approved study abroad program. If the student has received a 5 in the AP Spanish Language Exam, these 3 credits need to be replaced by a language or linguistics course at the 3000 level. SPAN 3300 must be taken at the University of Virginia, the U.Va. program in Valencia, or through an approved study abroad program. If the student has received a 5 in the AP Spanish Literature Exam, these 3 credits need to be replaced by a different literature and culture course. In order to take a 4000-level course in literature and culture or culture and civilization, a student must have previously completed at least one survey (3400s) course. Students in the Business Spanish minor are not required to take a survey or SPAN 3300 if they take SPAN 3010 at UVA. Ideally a major will take both survey courses before advancing to the 4000-level courses in literature and culture and in culture and civilization. Please note that Spanish majors may not take literature survey courses (3400s) during their fourth year, except as described above. Note that only one conversation course will count for the major. Concentration in Literature and Culture One prerequisite and 10 additional courses. Prerequisite: SPAN 2020 - Advanced Intermediate Spanish Credits:          3 ( or equivalent ) (Must be completed before declaring the major) SPAN 3010 - Finding your Voice in Spanish Credits:          3 SPAN 3300 - Texts and Interpretation Credits: 3 One Survey of Spanish Literature and Culture: SPAN 3400 - Spain: From Kingdom to Empire (1200 - 1700) Credits:          3 or SPAN 3410 - Perspectives on Modern Spain (1800 to the Present) Credits:          3 One Survey of Latin American Literature and Culture: SPAN 3420 - Politics and Power in the Early Americas (1492 - 1800) Credits:          3 or SPAN 3430 - Contemporary Latin American Voices (1800 to the present) Credits:          3 Six 4000-level Literature and Culture courses: SPAN 3010 must be taken at the University of Virginia, the U.Va. program in Valencia, or through an approved study abroad program.

Taking one survey course is a prerequisite for taking any 4000-level course in literature and culture. At least one survey must be taken at the University of Virginia or through a recommended study abroad program. Ideally a major will take both survey courses before advancing to the 4000 level courses in literature and culture. Please note that Spanish majors may not take literature survey courses during their fourth year. Concentration in Language and Linguistics One prerequisite and 10 additional courses.

Students wishing to study in Spain for major credit must enroll in a program approved by the department. The department operates one direct-credit program in Valencia, Spain.  Currently, only the Valencia program offers courses at the 2000, 3000 and 4000 level.  Students may also study in a number of other programs in Spain and Latin America that have been approved by the Spanish faculty. Consult the Director of Undergraduate Programs, or the departmental website for an up-to-date list of approved programs. Students who wish to study in a program that does not appear on this list must go through the petition process run by the International Studies Office, and must apply to the Director of Undergraduate Programs in Spanish.  They must provide a compelling academic reason for studying in a non-approved program. For information about how to count study-abroad credit toward the major in Spanish, please consult the sections on the major above. Independent Study Independent study with a faculty advisor is available to advanced students who wish to pursue specific areas in depth that are not included in the regular curriculum. All of these courses must be taught in Spanish and must have the “SPAN” prefix—as noted above, only courses taught in Spanish and with the “SPAN” prefix can count toward the Spanish major, the Spanish minor, and the Business Spanish minor. For an independent study course to count for the Spanish major it must be taken for a grade. Distinguished Majors Program Spanish majors of exceptional ability and dedication are encouraged to enroll in the Distinguished Major Program. Like other Spanish majors, the DMPs are required to take ten courses (30 credits) at the 3000-level or above. However, three of these courses must be 4000-level seminars or, with the approval of the DMP Coordinator, 5000-level courses. In addition to the ten courses (30 credit hours) required of all majors, DMPs take two additional courses (6 hours) devoted to researching and writing a thesis in Spanish. In the fall semester of their 4th year, DMPs enroll in Span 4890, “Distinguished Major Colloquium” (a 3-credit credit/no credit course), and meet regularly with the Coordinator to discuss research strategies and set intermediate goals. In the second semester of their 4th year, DMPs enroll in Span 4989, “Distinguished Major Thesis” (3 credits, grade option) and meet regularly with a faculty thesis adviser. DMPs present their research at a departmental colloquium in the spring of their final year. A departmental committee determines different levels of distinction (Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction), based on the quality of the student’s thesis, the student’s overall work in the major field of study, and the student’s overall college record (a minimum overall GPA of 3.4 is required). SPAN 4989 - Distinguished Major in Spanish Thesis Credits: 3 Language Requirement SPAN 1010 and 1020 are courses reserved exclusively for true beginners, students who have never studied Spanish before entering UVA. Students who have studied Spanish prior to coming to UVA and who wish to continue in Spanish will be placed according to scores obtained on the College Entrance Examination Board SAT II tests, the AP Exam, the IB (high level) exam, or the UVa Spanish placement exam. The sequence of courses, depending on the level at which the student begins, is as follows: SPAN 1010, 1020, 2010, 2020; or SPAN 1060, 2010, 2020; or SPAN 2010, 2020; or SPAN 2020. The sequence must be followed to complete the language requirement. Once students begin the sequence of courses, they cannot skip any course in the sequence. Students are not permitted to self-place in a language course. Students who place themselves incorrectly will receive an F for the courses in which they enroll without permission. SPAN 1010 is offered in Fall only and SPAN 1020 is offered in Spring only. All Spanish courses to be counted toward the language requirement must be taken at UVA or at a UVA approved study abroad program. Major in Latin-American Studies For major and minor requirements see the section on Latin American Studies.

Description of Captsone For the capstone, students will work in teams of 3 or 4 to complete an extensive data analysis project. The students and capstone faculty will work collaboratively to develop a hands-on project for each team to demonstrate knowledge and skill in data analysis, interpretation, and communication. Each project will require the team to determine the nature of the questions of interest; prepare data for analysis; select and perform the appropriate analysis; determine conclusions; and present the results. The capstone project will provide an opportunity to observe how students work through all aspects of a statistical analysis. Students will be guided and evaluated by the capstone faculty. The capstone experience will culminate with the submission of a final report and a formal presentation. If a student fails the capstone course, the Director of Undergraduate Programs will meet with the student to determine a set of revisions and/or alternative academic activities to complete their project. A student who fails to complete their project may retake the course in a subsequent semester. Additional Information For more information contact the Department of Statistics, 103 Halsey Hall, P.O.

Requirements for Degree At least 120 semester credits, with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.000 on all UVA course work, are required to earn the BPHM degree.  Depending on the number of credits transferred, students will need to complete 60-84 credits after admission to complete the degree. See https://www.scps.virginia.edu/bachelors-in-health-sciences-management/curriculum/ for degree requirements. Students admitted to the BPHM degree program are generally expected to complete all remaining degree requirements at the University.  Those who matriculated with fewer than 60 transfer credits and who wish to take academic courses at another institution after matriculation at UVA must confirm the transferability of course work in advance with appropriate SCPS staff. It is the student’s responsibility to provide an official transcript to the SCPS Central Admission Office as soon as outside course work is completed and to request that the additional transfer credits be posted to their official UVA record. Any transferable course work from other institutions must be completed prior to the semester in which the student enrolls in Capstone I (PSHM 4900).  Students are expected to have successfully completed at least 105 credits toward the BPHM degree in order to enroll in Capstone I. Time to Degree Students will generally enroll in 6 credit hours per term (fall, spring, and summer). They must complete the program in 21 terms (7 years). Academic Regulations and Options All students are subject to the academic policies specified in the section titled “University Regulations”. The following academic requirements and options apply to students in the BPHM program along with regulations listed in this Record under SCPS Academic Policies, Rules, and Regulations. Add/Drop Regulations Students may add courses, with instructor and academic advisor permission, until the published deadline for the semester. The add deadline is also the last day to change the grading option for courses. Students may drop courses without penalty until the published drop deadline. Students who withdraw from an individual course or all courses after the semester has begun will be charged tuition for the semester on a prorated scale. Students are responsible for the accuracy of their course enrollment record; changes to course enrollment may be made online through the Student Center in SIS, before the published deadlines. Advising Providing advising related to academic matters and student services is an important element of the BPHM degree program. All students receive individual academic advising from prior to their first term of enrollment in BPHM. Students are responsible for consulting with their advisors each semester before enrolling in courses. Academic advisors work closely with the student to plan the program of study, to monitor the student’s progress, and provide advice on matters pertaining to the program, academic policies, and procedures. Students and advisors should use the student’s UVA unofficial advising transcript to help monitor progress toward degree requirements. The academic advisor may also assist the student in identifying a faculty mentor to work with the student on the Capstone Project that is undertaken near the completion of the BPHM degree program. A student who wishes to take a non-BPHM UVA course for credit or a leave of absence from the program must secure approval from the academic advisor, as well as the BPHM Director. Course Load With a commitment to student success, BPHM advisors and/or administrators recommend appropriate course loads each semester during advising conversations. BPHM generally advises students to enroll in no more than 6 semester credits in their first semester in the program and during the semesters in which they are enrolled in Capstone II. However, the program provides flexibility that acknowledges a student’s individual circumstances, needs, and academic progress. Students who wish to register for more than 9 credits in a given term must acquire advisor and program director permission. Students who plan to apply for financial aid through the University need to carry a minimum of six credits per semester in order to be eligible for financial aid through the University. These students should contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine what the specific requirements are for the various types of aid they wish to receive.  Visit: www. sfs.virginia.edu Credit/No Credit Option Students may choose a credit/no credit (CR/NC) grading option up until the add deadline for courses. Instructors have the right to prohibit students from taking courses on a CR/NC basis. The Major Core Requirement courses and Capstone I and II courses must be graded and may not be taken CR/NC. BPHM students may take no more than one course per semester on a CR/NC basis, and a maximum of nine credits may be taken on a CR/NC basis during a student’s tenure in the BPHM program. Due to the global pandemic, grades of CR/GC/NC earned during the spring 2020, fall 2020, J-term 2021, spring 2021, and summer 2021 terms do not count against the maximum number of credits that may be earned on a CR/NC basis that is imposed by schools and departments. Honor System The Honor System is one of the University’s oldest and most venerated traditions. Based on the fundamental assumption that anyone who enrolls at the University subscribes to a code of ethics forbidding lying, cheating, and stealing, the Honor System allows students the kind of personal freedom possible only in an environment where respect and trust are assumed. For nearly 180 years, students have administered this system at the University. While the Honor System applies to students enrolled on- and off-Grounds through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, some procedures for administration of the system to continuing and professional studies students differ from those governing on-Grounds full time students. Off-Grounds students should consult the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website www.scps.virginia.edu or visit The Honor Committee website www.virginia.edu/honor for a copy of the by-laws under Governing Documents. Leaves of Absence Students who wish to take a voluntary leave of absence for either a semester or a calendar year must consult with the BPHM Director and apply for such leave through their Student Center in the Student Information System (SIS). The School of Continuing and Professional Studies requires students on leave to apply for readmission at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the semester in which they intend to reenroll. Academic Warning and Suspension Students may be placed on academic warning, with a notation appearing on their transcripts, if they: Fail to earn a minimum grade point average of 1.800 for the semester; Fail to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0; Earn more than one grade below C- in any given semester; Earn a grade below D in any course during two consecutive semesters Students on academic warning are expected to meet with their academic advisors prior to the end of the add/drop period so they may remedy their academic shortcoming(s). Students on academic warning who withdraw or take leaves of absence are eligible to return but do so on academic warning and are subject to suspension if they do not attain good standing within the first semester of their return. Suspension involves enforced withdrawal from the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. A student placed on academic warning in any semester may be suspended if he or she does not regain good standing at the end of the next semester.  A student who has been suspended may apply for readmission after one regular semester or one calendar year has elapsed since the date of suspension. The BPHM Director determines the amount of lapsed time before readmission. If readmitted, the student will remain on academic warning and will be suspended again if not in good standing. While on suspension, students may not earn credits to advance their progress toward the BPHM degree. Readmission Students who do not enroll at the University for more than two semesters and who are not on an approved leave of absence will be required to apply for readmission. Students returning from suspension will also be required to apply for readmission. Application for readmission must be made to the BPHM Director at least 30 days in advance of the next University registration period. Students should include with their applications a statement that (1) addresses their readiness to return to the program in light of any serious difficulties during their most recent enrollment (e.g., financial, medical, or personal hardship) and (2) outlines those courses that the student will take over the remaining semesters to qualify for a degree. Refunds The refund schedule for classes offered through the Bachelor of Professional Studies in Health Sciences Management is governed by the University’s refund schedule. For more information, please visit Student Financial Services www.sfs.virginia.edu/ Repeated Courses In accordance with the University policy , when a student earns D+, D, D-, F in a course and opts to take it the second time, both courses and their respective grades will appear on the transcript. Only the highest of the two grades will be used in calculation of the GPA. This GPA adjustment applies only to the first 9 credits of courses that are repeated. This GPA adjustment applies only to cases where both the original and the repeat course are completed at UVA and taken for a letter grade. The repeated course must be attempted no earlier than the Fall 2024 semester. If a student earns C- or higher and chooses to retake the course a second time for credit, both grades will be included in the computation of the grade point average and appear on the student’s transcript. A student may repeat a course only once.  The two courses, whether under the same course number or not, may not both be counted for degree credit. Satisfactory Academic Performance Students admitted to the BPHM program are expected to complete all degree requirements within seven years (i.e., twenty-one consecutive semesters including fall, spring, and summer) of matriculation into the program. Leaves of absence and suspensions do not change the requirement to complete all degree requirements within these parameters. All BPHM students are expected to maintain satisfactory academic progress toward the degree. To that end, each student’s academic standing is reviewed at the conclusion of each semester. Withdrawal The following policies govern withdrawal from the BPHM program as well as from individual courses: Course Withdrawal With the instructor’s permission, BPHM students may withdraw from a course with a grade of W, up to the midpoint of the course. After this cutoff, students must complete the course. With an endorsement from the professor, the BPHM Director will consider a student’s petition to withdraw from a course after the deadline because of compelling and highly unusual circumstances. Students who discontinue a course at any point without complying with the proper procedure are subject to a failing grade. Enforced Withdrawal The Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies may compel a student to withdraw from the BPHM program for good cause. A student who is asked to withdraw from the program may petition the dean for readmission after one calendar year. Medical Withdrawal A student may withdraw from the BPHM program for reasons of health with the approval of the Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies and BPHM Director. A notation of Medical Withdrawal will appear on the student’s transcript. Voluntary Withdrawal A BPHM student who wishes to withdraw from the program must formally withdraw from the University. The student is encouraged to meet first with the academic advisor of record; the student must meet with the BPHM Director for an exit interview. Leaving the program without following the requisite process results in the student’s receiving a grade of F in all courses that he or she fails to complete. A student who withdraws from the University voluntarily has the notation “Withdrawn [date]” recorded on his or her permanent academic record. Financial Aid BPHM students interested in applying for financial aid should consult the information provided by the office of Student Financial Services www. sfs.virginia.edu In general, requests for consideration of aid require that the student file the federal Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the UVA Undergraduate Financial Aid Application. Minimum semester credit requirements for federal financial aid may be greater than those required by the degree program. Information about the FAFSA can be found at www.fafsa.ed.gov ; information about the Office of Financial Aid is available at www. sfs.virginia.edu or by calling (434) 982-6000. Orientation Orientation for new students is a key to success in the BPHM program. New students are required to participate in all scheduled BPHM orientation activities. Prior to the beginning of classes, students are provided with information about registration, University e-mail accounts, student services, as well as academic advising. Honors Final Honors - Degrees with distinction, with high distinction, and with highest distinction are awarded to BPHM students who have earned a cumulative grade point average of 3.400, 3.600, and 3.800, respectively, on all UVA course work. Curriculum The BPHM curriculum has five components: upper-division Humanities and Social Sciences courses, Major Core Requirements, Approved Health Sciences Management Electives, and two Capstone Project courses. Courses listed below are subject to possible change as the curriculum is further developed. Students who enter BPHM with fewer than 60 transfer credits will need to complete more than the 60 credits outlined below to satisfy degree requirements. Students should consult with their faculty advisor to identify appropriate additional elective courses. Upper-Division Humanities and Social Sciences Requirements Regardless of admission pathway, students must complete 15 credits in upper-division humanities and social sciences courses as outlined below, typically taken from B.I.S. Program online course offerings. 2 humanities/fine arts courses (6 credits) 3 social sciences/history courses (9 credits) Note: At least three credits (one course) must be satisified by a course that deals substantially with a non-Western culture.

64,"Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies, B.I.S.","Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies, B.I.S. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Continuing and Professional Studies: Degree Programs The Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (B.I.S.) degree program is tailored to adults who wish to pursue an undergraduate degree through part-time study. Approved in 1999 by the Board of Visitors and the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the B.I.S. program makes it possible for students with earned college credits to complete undergraduate degrees. The B.I.S. program offers a challenging and intellectually stimulating curriculum with evening, weekend and online courses drawn from those already offered at the University or approved by University faculty specifically for this degree program. The program maintains a full course schedule in the summer, fall, and spring semesters; classes are primarly offered in an online synchronous format with some hybrid and asynchronous opportunities. The interdisciplinary curriculum of the B.I.S. program includes upper-level courses in academic fields that bring together both the range of learning implied by a liberal arts degree and the depth of knowledge associated with study at an advanced undergraduate level. The program emphasizes critical thinking, clear articulation of ideas, and the habits of individual and collective learning that develop and sustain life-long learners. Interdisciplinary Liberal Studies Seminars and Conduct of Inquiry courses in the Humanities and Social Sciences unique to the program are required of all students. Students will pursue an academic concentration within the degree program and must complete Capstone Project I and Capstone Project II in which they do independent research into a topic of their choice, based on their academic, professional, or personal interests or some combination of these, and write a substantial paper that reflects the depth and breadth of their educational experience. Students have seven years (twenty-one semesters, including fall, spring, and summer) after admission to the program to complete all requirements for the B.I.S. degree B.I.S. students are governed by the student-run Honor System and the Standards of Conduct described in the University Regulations section of the University Record, subject to revision by authorized University offices. Policies and procedures can be obtained from the University Honor Committee and the University Judiciary Committee. Academic policies and regulations of the B.I.S. program are under the aegis of the Curriculum and Course Review Committee, the Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, and the B.I.S. Director. To learn more about this undergraduate degree program, or to obtain application information, individuals should contact: B.I.S. Degree Program University of Virginia School of Continuing and Professional Studies P.O. Box 400764 Charlottesville, VA 22904-4764 800-346-3882 http://www.scps.virginia.edu Requirements for Degree Admission The Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree program is intended for adults who have earned 36-60 transferable semester credits from one or more regionally accredited colleges or universities, and are prepared to enter a rigorous program of study. Applicants must present a minimum of 36 transferable credits, to include sufficient course work to satisfy (a) the full English Composition requirement at their previous institution and (b) at least 12 additional credits toward the Liberal Studies Core general education requirement. Any remaining Liberal Studies Core general education requirements not satisfied upon admission must be completed with a C or better, whether they are taken at UVA or transferred from another institution. Applicants must complete a formal application for admission, be in good academic and social standing, and have earned at least a 2.0 cumulative grade point average at the institution they attended most recently. Additionally, applicants who have previously attended the University of Virginia must be in good financial, academic, and social standing with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0. Prospective students apply through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies’ admission process rather than through the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Although applicants submit transcripts from all previously attended colleges as part of their application, prospective students are strongly encouraged to upload their unofficial transcripts for a preliminary evaluation and feedback prior to beginning the application.  A consultation with a B.I.S. representative is a recommended component of the application process.  Admitted students must provide official transcripts from all previously attended colleges, including final grades for any pending course work. Official transcript must be sent directly from the institution or its clearinghouse to the SCPS Central Admission Office. Failure to provide official transcripts by the deadline will result in an enrollment block on the student’s account which will prevent course registration in subsequent academic terms. Degree Requirements To be awarded the B.I.S. degree, students must present 120 approved semester credits, including at least 60 credits earned at the University of Virginia, and successfully complete the B.I.S. curriculum, as outlined below in “Curriculum.” At least 51 credits taken at the University must have been completed on a graded (A+ to D-) basis. Students must have earned a 2.000 cumulative grade point average on all work taken at the University. Students are subject to the degree and curricular requirements in effect for the semester in which they were admitted to the B.I.S. program. Students who matriculated with fewer than 60 transfer credits and who wish to take academic courses at another institution after matriculation at UVA must confirm the transferability of course work in advance with appropriate SCPS staff. It is the student’s responsibility to provide an official transcript to the SCPS Central Admission Office as soon as outside course work is completed and to request that the additional transfer credits be posted to their official UVA record. After ordering the official transcript, the student must submit the Request for Post-Matriculation Transfer of Credit form, which is linked on the SCPS website. Any transferable course work from other institutions must be completed prior to the semester in which the student enrolls in Capstone I (ISCP 3991).  Students are expected to have successfully completed at least 105 credits toward the B.I.S. degree in order to enroll in Capstone I. Transfer of Credit The University grants transfer credit based on an analysis of the content, level, and comparability of the courses taken, the applicability of the courses to the student’s intended concentration and degree program, the quality of the student’s performance in the courses, and the accreditation of the institution at which the work was completed. Credits eligible for transfer must have been earned with at least a “C” grade (2.0 or better) and in courses comparable in content and rigor to those offered at the University of Virginia. Credits earned in a pass/fail grading system will only be eligible for transfer if certification is provided that the student earned at least a “C” average. Only credits transfer; grades do not transfer. Students receive no more, and may receive fewer, than the number of credits earned at the host institutions. No more than 60 semester credits, or half the number of credits required for graduation, transfer from a combination of approved testing programs (Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate) and course credits. Quarter and trimester credits are converted to semester credits. The general University policy on accepting credits from foreign institutions will apply. Credit for College Level Examination Placement credits, life experience credits, correspondence credits, military education credits, Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate testing is awarded according to guidelines used in the College of Arts and Sciences. Transfer credit is generally not granted for credit passed elsewhere by re-examination. Occasionally, credits earned through special programs such as Prior Learning Activities for Credit Evaluation (PLACE) at Northern Virginia Community College are considered. Courses required for a B.I.S. concentration do not transfer from other institutions into the B.I.S. degree. Credits earned in courses taken at other institutions while the student is enrolled in the B.I.S. program are only eligible for transfer if the student receives permission from B.I.S. administration before enrolling in the course(s). Students who have completed courses with the FBI National Academy or the National Criminal Justice Command College should consult with SCPS admissions staff to determine how those credits can be applicable to B.I.S. course requirements. The Liberal Studies Core The Liberal Studies Core demonstrates that students have studied a broad range of academic disciplines and are prepared for study at a more advanced level in a liberal arts program. Students must satisfy the English Composition requirement, generally with six semester credits. With sufficient supporting evidence, it may be possible for a student to satisfy this requirement with fewer than six credits. Upon admission to B.I.S., students must have satisfied the English Composition requirement, and at least twelve credits toward the Liberal Studies Core outlined below. Humanities: at least six semester credits earned in art history, selected architectural history courses, classics, literature, drama, film studies, fine arts, music (exclusive of performance), philosophy, political theory, religious studies, or western or eastern civilization or similar courses. Social Sciences: at least six semester credits earned in anthropology, economics, government and foreign affairs (except political theory), history (exclusive of western, eastern, or other civilization courses, which are considered humanities courses), psychology, or sociology. Math and/or Natural Science: at least eight semester credits earned in approved math, astronomy, biology, chemistry, environmental science, or physics. Generally, only courses comparable to those that satisfy an area requirement for the College of Arts and Sciences satisfy the Core. Additional Liberal Arts: at least ten semester credits in coursework that could satisfy the humanities, social sciences, math and/or natural science requirements. Any remaining Liberal Studies Core general education requirements not satisfied upon admission must be completed with a C or better, whether they are taken at UVA or transferred from another institution. Students should prioritize completion of any remaining general education requirements within their first four terms of enrollment in B.I.S. Business Concentration Prerequisites In order to declare a business concentration, students should have completed the following prerequisites or equivalents (generally before admission to the B.I.S. program). The University designations are listed first, followed by the Virginia Community College designations in parenthesis. Students should complete outstanding prerequisites before registering for upper division Business classes. COMM 2010: Introduction to Financial Accounting - 3 credits (ACC 211) ECON 2010: Principles of Economics: Microeconomics - 3 credits (ECO 202) ECON 2020: Principles of Economics: Macroeconomics - 3 credits (ECO 201) STAT 1100 or 1120: Introduction to Statistics - 3 credits (MTH 155 or 245) Courses presented to fulfill the prerequisites should be substantially similar in focus, content and objectives to these courses as they are described in the current University of Virginia Undergraduate Record . Psychology Concentration Prerequisites In order to declare a psychology concentration, students should have completed the following prerequisite or its equivalent. The University designation is listed first, followed by the Virginia Community College designation in parenthesis. Students should complete outstanding prerequisites before registering for upper division Psychology classes. PSYC 1010: Introduction to Psychology – 3 credits (PSY 200 or 201) Computer Competency Expectation While the B.I.S. program does not have a formal computer competency requirement, all students are responsible for gaining the computer skills needed to perform well in any B.I.S. course. Those skills include the following: e-mail; word processing; use of the Internet, especially for academic research and participation in online classes; and use of Excel and PowerPoint in some courses (these expectations will be noted on specific course syllabi). The B.I.S. staff can provide suggestions for course work that can help strengthen these computer skills prior to applying to the program. Access to a high-speed Internet connection is strongly recommended and will optimize access to the UVA web learning tools including electronic course materials, the UVA libraries, and UVA learning management systems. Demonstrating Success in B.I.S. To continue in the program, all B.I.S. students must maintain good financial and social standing at the University and complete the following academic requirements by the end of the fourth consecutive semester after B.I.S. matriculation. In certain circumstances, extensions of the first four term requirements may be extended to students by permission of the B.I.S. program. B.I.S. students are required to take ISLS 3000: Transformations: Reading, Thinking, and Communicating in the Liberal Arts during their first semester in the program and one additional 3000-level ISLS course within the first four academic terms. Students must obtain a grade of C or better in each of these courses to satisfy the requirement. B.I.S. students are required to take one Conduct of Inquiry course in the Social Sciences (ISIN 4510) and one Conduct of Inquiry course in the Humanities (ISIN 4520). It is strongly suggested that students complete these courses within the first four academic terms. Students must obtain a grade of C or better in each of these courses to satisfy the requirement. Either ISIN 4510 or ISIN 4520 must be completed prior to taking Capstone I. Cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 on all UVA course work (including courses completed prior to B.I.S. matriculation). A detailed concentration proposal if pursuing an Individualized Concentration (due by the time the student completes 12 credits in the B.I.S. program). Earn a minimum of 12 credits toward the B.I.S. degree after admission to the program. Satisfy any Liberal Studies Core general education requirements missing upon B.I.S. admission. Students who are unable to satisfy these requirements by the end of the fourth consecutive semester after B.I.S. matriculation may be required to leave the program or may be placed on Academic Warning. A student who is asked to withdraw from the program may, after waiting one full year, petition to re-apply. Academic Regulations and Options All students are subject to the academic policies specified in the section titled “University Regulations.” The following academic requirements and options apply to students in the B.I.S. program along with regulations listed in this Record under SCPS Academic Policies, Rules, and Regulations. Students who have questions about any such policies should contact their academic advisor. Add/Drop Regulations Students may add courses, with instructor and academic advisor permission, until the published deadline for the semester. The add deadline is also the last day to change the grading option for courses. Students may drop courses without penalty until the published drop deadline. Students who withdraw from an individual course or all courses after the semester has begun will be charged tuition for the semester on a prorated scale. To enroll in courses restricted by permission of the instructor, a student must submit to the B.I.S. office a course action form signed by the instructor. An e-mail communication directly from the instructor may substitute. Students are responsible for the accuracy of their course enrollment record; changes to course enrollment may be made online, through the Student Center in SIS, before the published deadlines. Advising Providing advice related to academic matters and student services is an important element of the B.I.S. degree program. All students receive individual academic advising prior to their first term of enrollment in B.I.S., and will receive a faculty advisor before their second term of enrollment. Students are responsible for consulting with their advisors each semester before enrolling in courses. Academic advisors work closely with the student to plan the program of study, to monitor the student’s progress, and provide advice on matters pertaining to B.I.S. academic policies and procedures. Students and advisors should use the student’s unofficial transcript to help monitor progress toward fulfilling degree requirements. The academic advisor may also assist the student with planning their Capstone Project. A student who wishes to take a non-B.I.S. UVA course for credit, more than nine credits in a semester, or a leave of absence from the program must secure approval from the academic advisor and the B.I.S. Director. Students must complete a Leave of Absence form, which is provided in SIS. Auditing A student enrolled in the B.I.S. program may audit B.I.S. program courses with the permission of the course instructor. Courses successfully completed on an audit basis have the AU recorded as the grade on the academic record. Because audited courses earn no credits or grade points, they are not applicable to the B.I.S. degree. The course instructor is the sole determinant of whether a student can take the course on an audit basis. The approved B.I.S. tuition and fee rates apply to audited courses, and students auditing courses are expected to meet all academic requirements of the course. Audited courses do not apply toward minimum or maximum credits when calculating course loads. Course Load With a commitment to student success, B.I.S. advisors and/or administrators recommend appropriate course loads each semester during advising conversations.  B.I.S. generally advises students to enroll in no more than 6 semester credits in their first semester in the program and during the semesters in which they are enrolled in Capstone II. However, the program provides flexibility that acknowledges a student’s individual circumstances, needs, and academic progress. Students who wish to register for more than 9 credits in a given term must acquire advisor permission. Students who plan to apply for financial aid through the University need to carry a minimum of six credits per semester to be eligible for financial aid through the University. These students should contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine what the specific requirements are for the various types of aid they wish to receive. http://sfs.virginia.edu Credit/No Credit Option Students may choose a credit/no credit (CR/NC) grading option up until the add deadline for courses. Instructors have the right to prohibit students from taking courses on a CR/NC basis. The required Liberal Studies Seminars, Conduct of Inquiry courses, concentration courses, Capstone Project I, Capstone Project II, and any courses used to satisfy Liberal Studies Core general education requirements must be graded and may not be taken CR/NC. B.I.S. students may take no more than one course per semester on a CR/NC basis, and a maximum of nine credits may be taken on a CR/NC basis during a student’s tenure in the B.I.S. program. Due to the global pandemic, grades of CR/GC/NC earned during the spring 2020, fall 2020, J-term 2021, spring 2021, and summer 2021 terms do not count against the maximum number of credits that may be earned on a CR/NC basis that is imposed by schools and departments. Honor System The Honor System is one of the University’s oldest and most venerated traditions. Based on the fundamental assumption that anyone who enrolls at the University subscribes to a code of ethics forbidding lying, cheating, and stealing, the Honor System allows students the kind of personal freedom possible only in an environment where respect and trust are assumed. For nearly 180 years, students have administered this system at the University. While the Honor System applies to students enrolled on- and off-Grounds through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, some procedures for administration of the system to continuing and professional studies students differ from those governing on-Grounds full time students. Off-Grounds students should consult the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website www.scps.virginia.edu or visit The Honor Committee website www.virginia.edu/honor for a copy of the by-laws under Governing Documents. Independent Study A  B.I.S. student who wishes to receive degree credit for an independent study must submit, with a faculty member’s endorsement, a proposed plan of study to include a course syllabus. This proposal must be approved by the B.I.S. Director no later than the mid-point of the semester prior to the semester in which the proposed independent study is to be undertaken. The student should have taken at least one course with that professor prior to submitting a proposal. In most circumstances, a maximum of three credits of independent study after matriculation to the program may be counted toward the B.I.S. degree. Approval of Independent Studies is at the discretion of the B.I.S. Director. Students are strongly encouraged to discuss their independent study idea with the Director before preparing a proposal. Intra-University Transfer B.I.S. students, as degree candidates at the University of Virginia, can apply for transfer to other schools of the University through the Intra-University Transfer process. Each school establishes its own criteria and procedures, and students in all schools are subject to them. Students interested in Intra-University Transfer are to discuss their intentions and reasons with their academic advisor and with the B.I.S. Director; contact the appropriate committee of the school to which the student seeks transfer in order to learn what is required; if the student is prepared to apply for transfer, write to the B.I.S. Director to state those intentions; follow that particular school’s steps to apply for transfer; and continue to function as a B.I.S. student until such time as a transfer application may be accepted and matriculation in a new degree program commences. Leaves of Absence A student who wishes to take a one-semester leave of absence must complete and submit a Leave of Absence request form in SIS. Students on approved leaves of absence are not required to apply for readmission to the B.I.S. program prior to their return, but should notify B.I.S. staff of their intended return at least 30 days before the open registration date for that semester. The University policy on Leaves of Absence may be found at http://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-011 . Minimum Grades The following courses must be completed with a grade of C or better: ISLS 3000; one additional 3000-level Liberal Studies Seminar; ISIN 4510; ISIN 4520; Capstone Project I and Capstone Project II, and any courses taken to satisfy Liberal Studies Core general education requirements. Courses taken to meet the concentration requirements must be completed with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0. Non-B.I.S. Courses Students enrolled in the B.I.S. program normally will complete their degree requirements by taking B.I.S. courses. Beginning with the second semester of B.I.S. enrollment, a student may be granted permission to take a course in another school or college of the University and to have that course count toward B.I.S. degree requirements. Before registering for any course outside SCPS, B.I.S. students must secure permission from the instructor and forward that to the B.I.S. Director for final approval. If advance approval is not obtained, non-B.I.S. courses may not be applied toward degree requirements. Students may apply a maximum of 18 credits of non-B.I.S. UVA courses to the B.I.S. degree after enrolling in the program. B.I.S. students pursuing an Individualized Concentration may be granted permission to take additional non-B.I.S. UVA courses for the concentration (3000 level and above) and/or for degree electives after enrolling in the B.I.S. program. Academic Warning and Suspension Students may be placed on academic warning, with a notation appearing on their transcripts, if they: Fail to earn a minimum grade point average of 1.800 for the semester; Fail to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.000; Earn more than one grade below C- in any given semester; Earn a grade below D in any course during two consecutive semesters. Students on academic warning must meet with their academic advisors prior to the end of the add/drop period so they may remedy their academic shortcoming(s). Students on academic warning who withdraw or take leaves of absence are eligible to return but do so on academic warning and are subject to suspension if they do not attain good standing within the first semester of their return. Academic suspension involves enforced withdrawal from the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. A student placed on academic warning in any semester may be suspended if they do not regain good standing at the end of the next semester. A student who has been suspended may apply for readmission after one regular semester has elapsed since the suspension date. If readmitted, the student will remain on academic warning and will be suspended again if not in good standing. Readmission Students who do not enroll at the University for more than two semesters, and who are not on an approved Leave of Absence, may be required to apply for readmission. Application for readmission must be made to the B.I.S. Director at least 30 days before the open registration date for the upcoming semester. Students should include with their applications a statement that (1) addresses their readiness to return to the program in light of any serious difficulties during their most recent enrollment (e.g., financial, medical, or personal hardship) and (2) outlines those courses that the student will take over the remaining semesters to qualify for a degree. In some circumstances, a student may be asked to formally reapply to the program by the published admission deadlines. Refunds The refund schedule for classes offered through the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies program is governed by the University’s refund schedule. For more information, please visit Student Financial Services http://sfs.virginia.edu Repeated Courses In accordance with the University Policy , when a student earns D+, D, D-, F in a course and opts to take it the second time, both courses and their respective grades will appear on the transcript. Only the highest of the two grades will be used in calculation of the GPA. This GPA adjustment applies only to the first 9 credits of courses that are repeated. This GPA adjustment applies only to cases where both the original and the repeat course are completed at UVA and taken for a letter grade. The repeated course must be attempted no earlier than the Fall 2024 semester. If a student earns C- or higher and chooses to retake the course a second time for credit, both grades will be included in the computation of the grade point average and appear on the student’s transcript. A student may repeat a course only once.  The two courses, whether under the same course number or not, may not both be counted for degree credit. Requests for Exceptions and Appeals Students who believe they should be exempted from prerequisite courses or other B.I.S. requirements or regulations may petition for an exception to the B.I.S. Director after they have consulted with their academic advisor. Satisfactory Academic Performance Students admitted to the B.I.S. program are expected to complete all degree requirements within seven years (i.e., twenty-one consecutive semesters including fall, spring, and summer) of matriculation into the program. Leaves of absence and suspensions do not change the requirement to complete all degree requirements within these parameters. All B.I.S. students are expected to maintain satisfactory academic progress toward the degree. To that end, each student’s academic standing is reviewed at the conclusion of each semester. Withdrawal The following policies govern withdrawal from the B.I.S. program as well as from individual courses: Course Withdrawal With the instructor’s permission, B.I.S. students may withdraw from a course with a grade of W, up to the midpoint of the course. After this cutoff, students must complete the course. With an endorsement from the professor, the B.I.S. Director will consider a student’s petition to withdraw from a course after the deadline because of compelling and highly unusual circumstances. Students who discontinue a course at any point without complying with the proper procedure are subject to a failing grade. Enforced Withdrawal The Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies may compel a student to withdraw from the B.I.S. program for good cause. A student asked to withdraw from the program may petition the Dean for readmission after one calendar year. Medical Withdrawal A student may withdraw from the B.I.S. program for reasons of health with the approval of the Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies and B.I.S. Director. A notation of Medical Withdrawal will appear on the student’s transcript. Voluntary Withdrawal A B.I.S. student who wishes to withdraw from the program must formally withdraw from the University. The student is encouraged to meet first with the academic advisor of record; the student must meet with the B.I.S. Director for an exit interview, fill out the appropriate paperwork, and turn in the University identification card. Leaving the program without following the requisite process results in the student’s receiving a grade of F in all courses that he or she fails to complete. A student who withdraws from the University voluntarily has the notation “Withdrawn [date]” recorded on his or her permanent academic record. Financial Aid B.I.S. students interested in applying for financial aid should consult the information provided by the office of Student Financial Services http://sfs.virginia.edu In general, requests for consideration of aid require that the student file the federal Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the UVA Undergraduate Financial Aid Application. Minimum semester credit requirements for federal financial aid may be greater than those required by the degree program. Information about the FAFSA can be found at www.fafsa.ed.gov ; information about the Office of Financial Aid is available at http://sfs.virginia.edu or by calling (434) 982-6000 Orientation Orientation for new students is a key to success in the B.I.S. program. New students must participate in all scheduled B.I.S. orientation activities, during which they are provided information about registration, University e-mail accounts, student services, academic advising and student groups. Student Activities and Services B.I.S. students have access to intramural and recreation activities and facilities, University Career Services, electronic mail, the Information Technology Center and its services, and other non-curricular activities. Peer Mentor Program The Peer Mentor Program is a student-run program that helps introduce and integrate new students into B.I.S. and the wider UVA community by providing support and information from a student perspective. Peer Mentors complement the faculty advisor and the B.I.S. staff in offering a type of support for students that can be most effectively provided by peers, but they do not substitute as academic advisors. Prospective Peer Mentors must have completed three semesters or 18 hours in the Program. Awards, Honors and Scholarships Alpha Sigma Lambda The University of Virginia hosts the Beta Iota Sigma chapter of Alpha Sigma Lambda, a national academic honor society for adult students in baccalaureate degree programs. The top 20% of B.I.S. students who have completed at least twenty-four credits at UVA since B.I.S. matriculation with a cumulative grade point average of 3.2 or higher are eligible to be considered for membership in the society. The cumulative grade point average will be calculated at the conclusion of the fall semester, with induction occurring in spring. Final Honors Degrees with distinction, with high distinction, and with highest distinction are awarded to B.I.S. students who have earned a cumulative grade point average of 3.400, 3.600, and 3.800, respectively, on all UVA course work. Osher Reentry Scholarship To be eligible for consideration in the Fall and Spring semesters, reentry students applying for this scholarship in B.I.S. must be pursuing their first baccalaureate degree, must demonstrate financial need, and must have experienced a cumulative gap of five or more years between their first pursuit of an undergraduate degree and their current enrollment in the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies program. Raven Society In the fall and spring, B.I.S. submits a list of eligible students to the Raven Society. Membership in the Society is based on evidence of strong commitment to the University and academic excellence. Stephen T. Thornton Outstanding Capstone Project Award This award(s) is given at the diploma ceremony each year to a graduating student(s) who has produced the best capstone project in B.I.S., as elected by a committee of faculty members and/or SCPS administrators. UVA B.I.S. Dean’s Scholarship The UVA B.I.S. Dean’s Scholarship is a one-time scholarship for incoming students to the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (B.I.S.) degree completion program. These scholarships help students pay for tuition, fees or other costs of attendance in their first semester of the B.I.S. program. The scholarship will award each recipient up to $2,500. Individuals who apply to the B.I.S. program and are accepted for admission will be considered. A separate scholarship application is not required. This is a merit-based scholarship, and recipients are selected based on their B.I.S. application essays and the overall strength of their application in demonstrating potential for success in the program. For more information, please contact scps-scholarships@virginia.edu B.I.S. Degree Requirements by Concentration The B.I.S. curriculum has five components: Liberal Studies Seminars; Conduct of Inquiry Courses; a concentration; degree elective courses; Capstone Project I and II.  The number of degree elective courses required will vary depending upon the student’s concentration and the number of credits upon admission. A minimum of nine credits of degree electives at the University must be in upper-division humanities/social sciences (e.g., 3000/4000 level ISSS or ISHU courses or approved courses from the College of Arts & Sciences). A maximum of 45 business related credits can be applied toward the 120 credits for the B.I.S. degree. Those applying to the Business concentration can transfer a maximum of 15 business credits at admission. Students pursuing a concentration in Business, Cybersecurity Analysis, Early Childhood, Healthcare Management, or Information Technology are generally expected to complete their degree electives in liberal arts courses from various humanities and social sciences disciplines. However, in consultation with the faculty advisor, a student may select electives from the concentration categories listed above. Stackable Credits Students who have completed the SCPS Information Technology, Cybersecurity Analysis, or Cloud Computing undergraduate certificate and are considering “stacking” the classes into the corresponding B.I.S. concentration (Individualized Concentration for Cloud Computing) should communicate that desire during the pre-admission advising process and in the application. Stackable courses from the certificate used to satisfy B.I.S. concentration requirements should be no more than seven years old when the B.I.S. degree is completed. A student may not simultaneously earn a B.I.S. degree and an SCPS Certificate. B.I.S. students who have recently completed the SCPS Information Technology, Cybersecurity Analysis, or Cloud Computing certificate, but are pursuing an alternative (non-stackable) B.I.S. concentration, may use some of those certificate credits as B.I.S. degree electives if they are no more than seven years old when the B.I.S. degree is completed. Students should consult with the B.I.S. Director upon admission to the program. Students who have completed courses at the FBI National Academy or the National Criminal Justice Command College should consult with SCPS admissions staff to determine how those credits can be applicable to B.I.S. course requirements. Concentrations The B.I.S. program offers students eleven concentration options. Courses that fulfill concentration requirements must be upper-division (3000-level or 4000-level). Art and Society Business Cybersecurity Analysis Early Childhood Healthcare Management History and Politics Individualized Information Technology Liberal Arts Psychology Writing Art and Society Concentration Liberal Studies Seminars (6 credits) These seminars provide students with opportunities to develop a core set of skills early in the B.I.S. Program. Art and Society concentrators are required to take two ISLS courses, the first of which is a required first-term course called ISLS 3000: Transformations: Reading, Thinking, and Communicating in the Liberal Arts, which addresses academic writing, critical thinking and research fundamentals. Conduct of Inquiry Courses (6 credits) Conduct of Inquiry courses introduce students to major methodologies, content areas and contributions in the humanistic traditions of various world cultures and various social science disciplines. Students are required to take one ISIN course in the Humanities and one ISIN course in the Social Sciences. Art and Society Concentration Courses (18 credits) Students will complete six courses from the list of approved Art and Society concentration courses maintained by B.I.S. advising. Degree Elective Courses  (24-48 credits) Students will complete twenty-four to forty-eight approved elective credit hours to complete the 120 hours required for graduation. Elective courses can include those other than from the list of approved Art and Society concentration courses. A minimum of nine credits of degree electives at the University must be in upper-division humanities/social sciences (e.g., 3000/4000 level ISSS or ISHU courses or approved courses from the College of Arts & Sciences). Capstone Project I (3 credits) The Capstone Project is the culminating activity of the B.I.S. Program in which students pursue independent research into a topic of their choice, based on their academic, or professional, or personal interests or some combination of these, and write a substantial paper that reflects a deep understanding of the topic. Students will present their research to an audience of faculty, students, and others at the end of the semester. This required course provides students an opportunity to strengthen their critical thinking, research, and communication skills while exploring the process of research and project design. Students will apply what they learn to develop a thoughtful proposal for their Art and Society Capstone Projects. Before registering for Capstone Project I - ISCP 3991, the student must have successfully completed the Liberal Studies Seminars requirements, have completed at least 105 credits toward the B.I.S. degree, including most of the concentration courses, have removed all incompletes, and be in good academic standing, that is, not be on academic warning.  Students also must have attended the Capstone information session and filed the Intent to Take Capstone Project I Form at least two months prior to the start of class. In addition, students must present to the Capstone Coordinator evidence in writing of a clear and reasonable Capstone Project idea, a desired Capstone Mentor, and a statement of the background (e.g., coursework, reading, prior studies, professional experience) appropriate to developing a successful proposal and project within the designated time. Enrollment in Capstone Project I should occur no earlier than three terms prior to graduation. An approved proposal and a grade of C or better in Capstone Project I are required before students may register for Capstone Project II. Due to the heavy workload and intensity of the course, it is highly recommended that students take no more than a total of six credit hours during the term of enrollment in Capstone Project I. Capstone Project II (3 credits) After the successful completion of Capstone I, students are eligible to enroll in Capstone II. Projects must be supervised by an approved faculty mentor.

69,"Kinesiology, B.S.Ed.","Kinesiology (BSEd) Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Education and Human Development: Degree Programs Program Description Kinesiology refers to the study of movement and is a multifaceted field of study in which movement or physical activity is the intellectual focus. Physical activity includes exercising for improvement of health and fitness; learning movement skills; and engaging in activities of daily living, work, sport, dance, and play. It involves the general population as well as special groups such as children and older adults; people with disabilities, injuries, or disease; and athletes. Majoring in Kinesiology opens the door for a career in everything from fitness-related industries, to teaching, coaching, and health-related fields like medicine, public health, and physical or occupational therapy. The School of Education and Human Development is dedicated to providing hands-on experiences for students. That means students not only learn in the classroom, but on the field, in the lab, in the clinic, and with faculty. Faculty prepare students for what comes beyond college—graduate school, medical school or a career in a variety of areas. The blend of experiences students receive as a Kinesiology major, especially the field and clinical practice, prepare them in ways that other majors cannot. Kinesiology students work alongside some of the area’s finest in the wellness field. The Kinesiology major leads to a B.S.Ed. degree. Students take courses both in the College of Arts and Sciences and in the School of Education and Human Development. Students are expected to meet all general education requirements in their first two years, so they can concentrate on Kinesiology courses in years three and four. Students who enter with dual enrollment, AP and/or IB credits can opt to accelerate their studies, earning a B.S.Ed. and M.Ed in five years. Accelerated study is available in Exercise Physiology and Kinesiology for Individuals with Disabilities. Interested students need to apply to one of the M.Ed. programs by October 15 of the fourth year. GRE scores are due before the end of fall semester. An admission decision is made before the beginning of spring semester. Residence Requirement (60 credits) A recipient of a B.S.Ed. degree from the School of Education and Human Development must complete at least 60 of the 120 credits required for graduation  at the University of Virginia. Exceptions for emergency situations may only be granted with the advisor’s and dean’s permission. In addition, all students must be full-time (12 credits minimum) during all semesters, except the final one. Though there are a number of required courses, students also have opportunities to shape coursework according to career goals, including adding a second major or a minor inside or outside of the School of Education and Human Development. A faculty member from kinesiology will serve as the academic advisor, assisting students with the selection of classes. The advisor will also help students consider optimal settings for gaining hands-on experiences in clinical, athletic, or school setting. Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement Students must earn a minimum GPA of 2.0 on all courses attempted at the University. B.S.Ed.

72,"Aerospace Engineering, B.S.","Aerospace Engineering, B.S. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Aerospace engineering is concerned with the science and technology underlying the behavior and design of vehicles and systems that operate within the atmosphere and in space. It requires knowledge of a wide range of subject areas, including the basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences as well as specialized studies in aerodynamics, propulsion systems, structures, materials, flight dynamics, astronautics, and computational methods. This broad background qualifies the graduating engineer not only to handle problems that are special to the aerospace field, but also to meet challenges of an interdisciplinary nature facing society, such as those involving the environment, transportation, and energy resources. The Aerospace Engineering curriculum provides a thorough background in fluid dynamics, structures, propulsion, controls, flight dynamics and design. The curriculum provides flexibility with regard to all areas of potential aerospace practice by emphasizing applied science, design, and technology while providing a firm foundation in mathematics and physics.  Students will use symbolic and high-level mathematics tools, solid modeling and finite element analysis tools, as well as computational fluid dynamics and materials selection tools.  They also have access to a state-of-the art rapid prototyping facility with numerous 3D course printers, CNC machines, laser cutters, and the like.  The rapid prototyping facility can be used both for course work, as well as individual entrepreneurial initiatives.  With a strong science and mathematics based education, aerospace engineers have also found employment opportunities outside of the traditional aerospace industry. Many work in oceanography, biotechnology, weather prediction, energy conservation, and in the petrochemical, nuclear or automotive industries. In addition, the aerospace design provides an excellent background for business, law or medicine. Of course, people with the ambition to become pilots, either military or commercial, find the aerospace degree very attractive. Aerospace engineering principles are reinforced and integrated through design assignments and  significant “hands-on” experience with the latest in test equipment and modern experimental methods. A three-semester lab sequence builds on a basic skills and science background to develop an appreciation for measurement techniques and apparatus as well as to demonstrate aerodynamic concepts.  Students also develop communications skills and learn about the complex cultural, legal, ethical and economic factors which influence the engineering profession. Students who wish to may select courses that satisfy the requirements of a minor area of study (e.g., materials science, computer science, physics and engineering business, economics). Program Objectives Graduates of the Aerospace Engineering program at the University of Virginia have the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that allow them to make tangible contributions, meet new technical challenges, contribute effectively as team members, and be innovators in the analysis and design of aerospace vehicle systems.  They communicate effectively and interact responsibly with colleagues, clients, employers and society.

73,"Biomedical Engineering, B.S.","Biomedical Engineering, B.S. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Program Objective: Graduates draw upon their biomedical engineering foundations to perform experimental measurement, quantitative analysis, and engineering design. Graduates use tools and methods at the current state-of-the-art in biomedical engineering. Graduates apply problem solving abilities and multidisciplinary perspectives to understand and advance scientific discoveries and technological innovations. Graduates act to improve global and human health. Graduates exhibit intellectual curiosity, creativity, leadership and continuous personal growth. Program Description Biomedical engineering is built upon the premise that the tools and methods of engineering can be used to improve human health and enhance our understanding of the biological world. Biomedical engineering education integrates mathematics, science, engineering methodology, and engineering design to train individuals who are uniquely prepared for the collaborative challenges of this field. The end result of this type of training is knowledge, devices, materials, techniques and treatments to enhance human health. The foundation for these applications is the steady stream of discovery emerging from our nation’s academic and industrial research programs. The Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) has offered degrees at the master’s and doctoral level since 1967. BME introduced a bachelor’s of science degree in biomedical engineering in 2003. The major begins with an early, sound underpinning in the life sciences via two semesters of quantitative mammalian physiology and one semester of cell and molecular biology, alongside foundational knowlege in computational systems. Engineering fundamentals are taught in the context of biomedical engineering examples in systems analysis, biomechanics, and biotransport. In the 3rd year BME majors complete a two-semester IDEAS Lab, integrating concepts and skills from prior BME and other engineering course work. The BME major culminates in the 4th year with a capstone design project where students select, formulate, and solve a biomedically relevant design problem whose deliverables include a device, therapeutic, and/or system. Throughout all four years, electives offer additional breadth and depth. The department encourages students to participate in research and inquiry-based learning above and beyond what is required by the curriculum. In the past students have pursued paid, volunteer, and “for-credit” positions in research labs, on design projects, and in industry or research internships. Research strengths in the department include systems biology and biomedical data science, tissue engnineering and biomaterials, biomedical imaging, gene and drug delivery, and biomechanics and mechanobiology. Interdepartmental research collaboration links the department with School of Engineering and Applied Science departments and clinical and basic science departments in the School of Medicine and the College of Arts and Sciences. Biomedical engineers contribute to society from positions in universities, hospitals, government, the medical device and pharmaceutical industries, and a broad range of research enterprises. As the discipline grows, BME graduates are finding that their broad education provides an excellent platform from which to launch rewarding careers; begin graduate studies; or pursue advanced degrees in medicine, law, and business.

An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions. An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Many chemical engineers serve in the traditional chemical process industries of fuels, food and consumer products, chemicals, paper, pharmaceuticals, and plastics. Some develop new products or processes through research, while others carry out the pilot studies and design work needed to bring innovations from the laboratory to manufacturing operations. Many are engaged in the operation and management of process plants including areas related to process safety risk management, and environmental health and safety. Others engage in marketing, and develop new applications for chemical products and serve as data analysts or as consultants in technical and financial sectors. Often a chemical engineer moves from one function to another throughout their career. Chemical engineers have long aided in energy and materials production from oil, gas, and coal. Today they are also heavily involved in research, development, and production of energy from alternative and sustainable renewable resources. Similarly, their chemical expertise and broad knowledge of processes are valuable in the identification and control of environmental problems, health care, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and in areas such as electronic materials production and nanotechnology. A chemical engineer’s career path is varied and rewarding and allows individual talents to grow and be fully utilized. In preparation for professional careers and graduate school, undergraduate studies for the B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering obtain a strong foundation in both science and engineering. The curriculum progresses from mathematics and basic sciences  (with an emphasis on chemistry), through engineering sciences, to applications in chemical process analysis, and culminates in a capstone design project. Computer methods, laboratory techniques, open-ended problem solving, team approaches, and effective written and oral communication are emphasized throughout the program. Elective courses permit minors or concentrations in diverse technical and non-technical areas. Recent students have completed minors in many other engineering and science disciplines, in business, and in many different humanities and liberal arts programs. Students in the ChE program not only develop technical capability, but also learn to consider the safety, environmental, ethical, cultural, and economic dimensions of technological activities. Minimum Grade Requirements for ChE Prerequisite Courses A grade of C or CR is the standard required in core CHE courses that are prerequisites for other CHE courses. Students cannot have more than one passing grade of less than C or CR in core CHE prerequisite courses in order to enroll in any subsequent CHE courses. Students with more than one grade below C and/or CR in more than one core CHE prerequisite course (CHE 2202, 2215, 2215, 3316, 3318, 3321, 3322, 3398, 4474 and 4475) will have to retake the prerequisite(s) and receive a grade of CR or C or higher before taking any subsequent CHE courses. This policy applies to student pursuing the B.S. degree or the minor in chemical engineering. First-Year and Second-Year Program Chemical engineering students take two-semesters of general chemistry during the standard first-year engineering program. Because of varied individual long-term goals and the many options available in the chemical engineering program, consultation with a CHE advisor in the first semester of studies is strongly recommended. For example, the second semester chemistry course and laboratory are required for CHE majors and should be taken during the first year. Further, those planning on medical school should schedule a full year of biology, including laboratories.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Civil Engineering is the broadest of all engineering professions, and encompasses the application of science and technology to the planning, design, analysis, construction, operation and maintenance of the infrastructure and natural environment. The U.Va. Civil Engineering program, which was founded in 1836, is now designed to allow students to tailor their undergraduate degrees to their interests and goals, with curricular tracks in infrastructure systems, environmental and water resources, construction engineering and management, and structural engineering.  All tracks lead to a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering.  The program also supports a minor in civil engineering, and graduate degrees at the Master of Engineering, Master of Science and Ph.D. levels. Civil engineers are the fabricators of modern society and the protectors of our environment. Our civil engineering program emphasizes the complex interrelationships between infrastructure, social systems, and the environment.  We develop civil engineers who will seek to sustainably and equitably design, management and construct infrastructure systems, and who are prepared to innovate with new materials and create and use digital and virtual technologies.  Civil infrastructure is diverse, including many subsystems such as stormwater and drinking water systems, waste management systems, neighborhoods, highways, railways, high-rise buildings and bridges.  We develop the insight to anticipate how changes in one subsystem may affect the others and ultimately the environment, energy systems, communities, and the quality of life. Graduates with a BS degree in civil engineering may opt for employment with engineering and consulting ﬁrms; local, state, or federal governments; contractors or construction ﬁrms; public utilities; or industrial corporations. Many will attend graduate school to create more advanced employment opportunities in government, consulting, construction, or industry, and to introduce new choices, including research and teaching. Our students participate in research on a global scale through the engineering thesis and capstone experience, as well as a variety of exciting experiential programs, such as the minor in engineering business, the Science and Technology Policy Internship Program, study abroad programs, and interdisciplinary study within the School of Engineering and Applied Science and throughout the University. For more information about the civil engineering undergraduate program, visit the department’s web site at https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/civil-and-environmental-engineering/academics/undergraduate . Program Objectives To provide graduates with the technical competencies and insight necessary to practice civil engineering and have an impact on the profession and pursue professional licensure. To provide a solid foundation for successful study at leading graduate and professional institutions. To promote a breadth of abilities and knowledge, including quantitative and analytical skills, communication skills and social insight, to allow graduates to pursue careers in a diversity of ﬁelds including engineering, business, and management. To prepare graduates for a lifetime of learning, for leadership, and for service to the profession and society. Civil Engineering Curriculum (128 Credits) Minimum required for graduation:  128 credits Civil Engineering Civil engineering students share common degree requirements for the ﬁrst two years or four semesters before selecting one of four tracks: Infrastructure Systems (IS), Environmental & Water Resources (EWR), Construction Engineering and Management (CEM) or Structural Engineering (SE). Regardless of track, during the last two years, all CE students have 20 hours of the same required courses, plus 18 hours of electives in common. Thus, there is effectively a set of 25 remaining credit hours that may differ between these tracks. Footnotes follow the curriculum, which is listed by semester and explain which electives are credited as Science I, Humanities & Social Sciences (HSS), Technical I and II, Civil Engineering, Technical, Unrestricted, or track-specific electives. All four tracks are designed to provide students with a solid foundation for the practice of civil engineering and for subsequent graduate study. The Infrastructure Systems (IS) track provides a broad civil engineering education to prepare students to become practicing, licensed civil engineers, while still providing great career flexibility. This track includes training in structural design and materials, transportation, water resources, and geotechnical infrastructure design and planning. This track emphasizes hands-on laboratories and computer modeling and simulation workshops. The Environmental & Water Resources (EWR) track focuses on courses designed to provide a foundation for students interested in pursuing a career in environmental and water resources. The motivation for this track is the ever-increasing professional and societal emphasis on environmental quality and sustainability. The Construction Engineering and Management (CEM) track prepares students to transform engineering designs into infrastructure.  The construction of civil engineering infrastructure typically requires the orchestration of a complex team of contractors, regulatory and safety constraints, and substantial investment.  The CEM track combines civil engineering skills with the business and management skills required to create infrastructure. The Structural Engineering (SE) track allows students to focus on developing skills to design and construct large structures, such as bridges, stadiums, and high-rises.  All students in this track learn the basics of CEM and complete additional courses emphasizes design using various building materials.  Students in this track are well-prepared for practice or advanced studies in structural engineering.

79,"Engineering Science, B.S.","Engineering Science, B.S. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Engineering Science (ES) is an interdisciplinary undergraduate engineering degree program. Students select an engineering science major in order to pursue interests in technical areas which lie at the interstices of traditional engineering disciplines or combine elements of engineering and science not currently possible through other degree programs. This degree program prepares students for careers in engineering or graduate study in fields for which there are no established undergraduate degree programs at the University of Virginia. The ES degree program recognizes that technology and society are evolving at such a rapid pace that a new discipline could emerge as an established career field before it is institutionalized as a degree offering. This program also affirms the unique role of the engineering scientist in the technology path from innovation to societal impact. Engineering Science students, in collaboration with their advisors, define a plan of study (POS).  The POS identifies the curricular track, the primary technical minor, the secondary technical minor, and an area of concentration (AOC). The primary minor must satisfy the specific requirements of an approved technical minor in the School of Engineering and Applied Science and must consist of at least six courses; the secondary minor must be selected from approved SEAS technical minors or from the natural science or mathematics minors within the College of Arts and Sciences. The courses required for specific minors are as listed by the relevant department in SEAS or CLAS. AOC courses are chosen to define clearly the major field of study or to add depth to the student’s plan. The advanced project courses, which may be used as a basis for the senior thesis, are designed to provide a research or engineering design experience, which unifies the three main components making up the plan of study.  In all cases, both an advisor and the ES Program Director must approve the specific plan of study in order to guarantee that all degree requirements are being met. The flexibility offered by the Engineering Science degree program makes it an attractive degree for the following reasons: Engineering Science provides a rigorous technical curriculum, integrating engineering, natural science, and mathematics. It is especially suited for students interested in graduate study and/or basic research and development. In addition, it provides a path for preparation for professional training in law, business or medicine. As an interdisciplinary engineering program, Engineering Science prepares students for a career in an emerging field of engineering, in a field at the interstices of two existing engineering disciplines, or in a discipline for which there is presently no undergraduate degree offering at the University of Virginia. Engineering Science offers sufficient flexibility to allow study abroad, research-for-credit courses, and internships.

80,"Materials Science and Engineering, B.S.","Materials Science and Engineering, B.S. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is a field that couples basic and applied studies in physics, chemistry and mechanics on the atomistic and nanometer scales with macroscopic materials’ properties. Materials science is frequently an important enabler for many other scientific and engineering disciplines. For instance, advances in performance for future subsonic and hypersonic aircraft require new materials with greater durability at high temperatures and high strength-to-weight ratios. Advances in communication equipment with the introduction of fiber optic cables are brought about through the utilization of ceramic fibers which minimize attenuation of light signals and transmit much more information than is possible with electrically conducting wires. Advances in materials science and engineering enable the development of new technologies across most engineering disciplines. MSE offers a selection of undergraduate courses with the objective of providing students with a fundamental background in the structure, properties, processing, and performance of materials. This background is essential to engineers or scientists in understanding the selection of materials for various applications. A minor in Material Science and Engineering is available to all undergraduate students.

Total Credit Hours - 127 Description of Capstone and Thesis All engineering undergraduates participate in a capstone thesis as part of their degree program requirements.  The capstone thesis for the proposed degree program will consists of two components.  One component, which relates to the project that the students will perform (ENGR 4010/4020) will be guided and technically evaluated by faculty from the Material Science and Engineering (MSE) department.  The other component (STS 4500/4600), which covers the science, technology, and society aspects of the students’ chosen project, as well as aspects of style, writing and ethics will be taught by the Department of Engineering and Society.  The MSE faculty will work collaboratively with each other and the students to develop a range of projects to demonstrate students’ knowledge and skill in materials science and engineering and communication as the students apply their skills to real-world engineering problems at home or abroad.  The design projects may range from company-sponsored projects to contextual engineering challenges that are facing society. Working with the faculty members, students will work in teams of 4 to 8 to produce a thesis prospectus in the fall, followed by a complete technical thesis in the spring.  The capstone experience will culminate with the submission of a final report of approximately 25 pages and a formal presentation. If a student fails a portion of the capstone course components, the student’s faculty advisor will meet with the corresponding faculty in both the engineering design course sequence (ENGR 4010/4020) and the science, technology, and society course sequence (STS 4500/4600) to determine a set of revisions and/or alternative academic activities to complete the project. A student who fails to complete their project may retake the course in a subsequent semester.  Typically, ENGR 4010 and STS 4500 are taken in the same semester followed by ENGR 4020 and STS 4600 in the next semester.  Students can complete the courses out of sequence providing all requirements for the capstone and thesis are met.

81,"Mechanical Engineering, B.S.","Mechanical Engineering, B.S. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Mechanical engineering is the broadest of the engineering disciplines, providing opportunities for employment in industry, business, government, research, and education. The mechanical engineer is concerned with the development of machines and systems for diverse applications in our modern technological society. Talents and interests of a graduate M.E. include those required to plan, analyze, design, and improve components and systems. The practice of mechanical engineering is applied to manufacturing, energy conversion, transportation, construction, and environmental control. In the future, mechanical engineers must provide leadership in developing new sources of power and new systems to accommodate societal demands. Students take a sequence of basic and engineering science courses. They develop engineering problem solving skills in the areas of mechanics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, materials and automatic controls. Students learn to use higher mathematics, statistics and modern computer techniques and productivity tools. Students will use symbolic and high-level mathematics tools, solid modeling and finite element analysis tools, as well as computational fluids dynamics and materials selection tools. They also have access to a state-of the art rapid prototyping facility with numerous 3D printers, CNC machines, laser cutters, and the like. The rapid prototyping facility can be used both for course work, as well as individual entrepreneurial initiatives. Mechanical engineering principles are reinforced and integrated through design assignments and “hands-on” laboratory courses in experimental methods, digital electronics, and electro-mechanical systems. Students conduct experiments in labs where they use digital data acquisition systems to evaluate the performance of instruments, motors, engines, electrical circuits, signal processing equipment and solid state control devices. For each lab module, students develop a hypothesis, design the experiment, carry out the test, and perform the data analysis. The three-semester lab sequence familiarizes students with the state-of-the-art equipment used in modern industry. Working both individually and in teams, students also develop communications skills and learn about the complex cultural, legal, ethical and economic factors which influence the engineering profession. Those who wish to may select courses that satisfy the requirements of a minor area of study (e.g., computer science, materials science, physics and engineering business). Young engineers need relevant experiences to be competitive in the global economy. As indicated by discussions with recruiters and industry leaders, graduating students are now expected to have some practical and/or unique experience that they will be able to apply in an industry in the near term. These experiences may come from laboratory work, projects at the University, or summer jobs or internships with industry. Program Objectives Graduates of the Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Virginia have the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that allow them to make tangible contributions, meet new technical challenges, contribute effectively as team members, and be innovators in the analysis, design, and implementation of mechanical devices and systems.  They communicate effectively and interact responsibly with colleagues, clients, employers and society.

This program is a two-year part-time hybrid program. Students enroll in 30 credits at the University of Virginia. Classes are offered in a part-time format to allow students to maintain employment while completing their BSN.  In the hybrid format, students attend classes in person approximately once a month. Students are admitted to one of three locations: Charlottesville, Richmond or Northern Virginia. The program provides a foundation for professional practice and embraces the philosophy of life-long learning, encouraging further education such as graduate study for advanced practice or preparation as a clinical leader or teacher. The 120 hours of credit are earned as 48 general education requirements, 42 credit hours for select core nursing course in their prelicensure program, and the 30 credit hours of residency. The 42 credit hours are awarded for core academic nursing courses, taken in the student’s basic nursing program, that are comparable to core courses in UVA’s traditional BSN program.
