Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Architecture: Degree Programs Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the School of Architecture, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Requirements Undergraduate students entering the School of Architecture share a Common First Year in the School of Architecture . Students take core courses in Architectural History, Architecture, and Urban & Environmental Planning to provide a framework for the study of\\xa0the built environment\\xa0through observation, analysis, and design. Students must pass each core course with a grade of C- or higher. During the spring semester of the first year, students choose an intended major: Bachelor of Architectural History (BArH), Bachelor of Science Architecture, or Bachelor of Urban and Environmental Planning. The undergraduate curriculum in architectural history provides an introduction to the discipline within a liberal arts program.\\xa0Students select one of the following two concentrations: Architectural History or Historic Preservation. Students in both concentrations take the first-year School of Architecture curriculum, including ARH 1010 and ARH 1020. ARH 4591(certain ARTH 4591 courses may be substituted with permission of the Director of the Undergraduate Program) is taken in the third year as a preparatory research and writing course for the thesis. ARH 4999, taken during the fourth year, allows students to research and write an independent advanced paper on a topic of their choice while working closely with a faculty member in the department. Under certain circumstances, permission may be requested from the Director of the Undergraduate Program to work with a faculty member from outside the department. This thesis, with faculty comments, becomes part of the student’s permanent record. Those students considering the\\xa04+1 Track in the\\xa0Master of Architectural History\\xa0program should take ARH 4999 during the fall semester of their fourth year. International travel and education abroad can provide unparalleled opportunities for students to refine and extend their study of architectural history. Department faculty enthusiastically encourage international study, and advisers work closely with students to integrate rigorous and rewarding study abroad experiences into their major. All students must take courses in the following areas in the College of Arts & Sciences as general education requirements: 6 credits in Natural Sciences/Mathematics, 6 credits in English/Foreign Literature (one of which must be ENWR), 6 credits in Historical Studies/Social Sciences. Students must demonstrate an intermediate level of competency in a foreign language. (4) Grading Standards Students must have a minimum of 122 credits with at least a 2.000 GPA in order to graduate with a Bachelor of Architectural History degree (10). The department also offers a minor in Architectural History, and a minor is also available in Historic Preservation. Concentrations Architectural History This concentration allows students to focus on architectural history from all periods and prepares them to write a thesis on a subject of their choice. To ensure breadth of knowledge, students must take at least one course from all four of the following distribution areas: the Americas, Asia & the Pacific, Africa & the Mediterranean, and Europe. An additional four Architectural History electives (12 credits) may be taken in areas of the student’s choice. The content of at least two courses taken to fulfill major requirements must be primarily before 1400. These courses must include ARH 4591 and ARH 4999. Appropriate historic preservation, landscape architecture, and art history courses may be used to fulfill architectural history requirements after consultation with the Director of the Undergraduate Program. The following is a recommended course of study. The sequence may be altered in consultation with the student’s advisor.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Architecture: Degree Programs At UVA School of Architecture, our undergraduate Architecture programs are framed by an innovative curriculum that addresses the many ways in which design shapes and invents the world around us. The work of our students and faculty is investigative, critical, articulate, experimental and rigorous. The undergraduate curriculum in Architecture introduces students to methodologies to critically understand and creatively transform the built environment. Design innovation requires creativity, technical knowledge, cultural awareness, risk-taking, and meaningful questioning. Our curriculum uses design as a mode of critical inquiry to explore questions and pose new visions for a range of scales, all of which constitute the disciplinary realm of architecture: from cities, territories, infrastructure, and buildings to rooms, installations, furniture, and clothing. The first year of study is a shared Common First Year curriculum, wherein students take courses in three School of Architecture departments: Architecture, Urban + Environmental Planning, and Architectural History. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the School of Architecture, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Requirements Undergraduate students entering the School of Architecture share a common first-year curriculum. Students take core courses in Architectural History, Architecture and Urban and Environmental Planning to provide a framework for the study of contemporary culture through observation, analysis, and considered design of our ongoing constructed occupation of the earth. Students must pass each core course with a grade of C- or higher. For the first year curriculum, please refer to Common First Year in the School of Architecture. During the spring semester of the first year, students choose an intended major: Bachelor of Science Architecture, Bachelor of Architectural History, or\\xa0Bachelor of Urban and Environmental Planning.

Academic Warning A student will be placed on academic warning\\xa0if they fail to maintain academic good standing in any semester (see the “Academic Good Standing” section of the Record). Part-time students incur academic probation if they do not maintain a cumulative 2.000-grade\\xa0point average. Academic Suspension Suspension is enforced withdrawal from the University. Any student who has previously been placed on academic probation will be suspended if placed on probation again. The term of the first suspension is through at least one full fall or one full spring semester. The term of a suspension may be longer, if the Dean’s Office decides it is appropriate for the circumstances. A second suspension is final and the student is not allowed to return to the University. Procedures for Returning to the University from suspension are described below under Returning to the University. Academic credits taken elsewhere while on academic suspension are not accepted for transfer towards a UVa degree. Attendance Students are expected to attend all class sessions in person, including lectures and other prescribed activities of the courses for which they are registered. Although the course instructor sets course attendance requirements, any student who is absent from more than 50 percent of the class sessions may automatically receive a grade of F in that course. Consistent with the UVA Undergraduate Record, unless otherwise notified by the instructor, students enrolled in all School of Architecture undergraduate courses are required to attend every scheduled class session in person and to arrive on time prepared for the class. If you are unable to attend a class session for any reason, you must notify your instructor in advance of the class. In courses where class participation represents a portion of the course grade, the instructor has complete discretion to assign the class participation grade that s/he decides is appropriate. Faculty may drop students from their course with notification who are not in attendance on the first day of the semester. Class Standing Students are categorized by class according to the number of credits they have earned as follows: first year: 0-29 credits; second year: 30-59 credits; third year: 60-89 credits; fourth year: 90 or more credits. AP and transfer credits are included in the computation of class standing; credits not completed or completed unsuccessfully are not included. Students in the Department of Architecture are classified according to their studio level. Satisfactory Progress Toward a Degree In order to enroll for a fifth semester , students must have earned at least 54 semester hours (includes approved summer, transfer, AP, IB and dual enrollment credits). To enroll for a seventh semester , students must have earned at least 84 semester hours\\xa0(includes approved summer, transfer, AP, IB and dual enrollment credits). Students may not enroll in a ninth semester except under very special circumstances. Barring unusual circumstances, and with the written approval of the Dean’s office, students who have completed eight semesters must complete any remaining degree requirements as a part-time student. Students are permitted to take a total of 16 credits on a part-time basis toward the degree. No more than\\xa06 credits/two courses may be taken in a given semester. Appeals from Students Grade Appeals Students who wish to appeal a grade must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the course. If there is not a satisfactory outcome, the student must consult with the Director of Advising in conjunction with the undergraduate program director of the department. If this path proves unsuccessful in the resolution of the matter, the student may appeal to the Associate Dean of Academics. Appeals must be made within 7 days after the end of that semester’s examination period. Grievances Procedures Due process is guaranteed to all students. See “Grievance Procedures” in the University Regulations section or consult the Associate Dean of Academics. Awards for Academic Excellence Dean’s List To be eligible for the Dean’s List of Distinguished Students at the end of each semester, students must earn at least 15 credits of graded work, with a GPA of 3.7 or above for that semester.\\xa0 Courses taken on a CR/NC basis may not be counted toward the 15-credit minimum. Commencement Honors Students who have demonstrated high academic achievement in pursuit of the bachelor’s degree are eligible for commencement honors. Diplomas inscribed “with honors” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.600. Diplomas inscribed “with high honors” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.750. Diplomas inscribed “with highest honors” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.900. Curricular Requirements General Education Requirements in the School of Architecture Undergraduate Curriculum The undergraduate curriculum of the School of Architecture reflects our mission: to teach students how to study buildings, landscapes, and cities as forms and systems, and to imagine the design of more sustainable, functional, and socially equitable places. Students pursue this mission through three different majors: architectural history, architecture, and urban and environmental planning. The School’s general education requirements establish a strong foundation in the traditional liberal arts categories of humanities/fine arts, social/behavioral sciences, and natural sciences/mathematics. The general education curriculum is intended to equip students with the necessary tools of analytical, synthetic, and critical thinking, while also highlighting the role of the built environment in the complex conditions that profoundly shape the present and the future. The School of Architecture requires that each undergraduate complete 30 credits in General Education, 18 of which are to be taken in these categories: Humanities/Fine Arts: 6 credits Math/Natural Sciences: 6 credits Social/Behavioral Sciences: 6 credits The remaining 12 credits may be fulfilled with classes from within any of these three above-listed categories unless proscribed more specifically by the student’s major curriculum. General Education Course Curriculum in the Common First Year Humanities Elective: 3 credits Math/Nat Science Elective: 3 credits Social/Behavioral Science Elective: 3 credits General Education Elective: 3 credits For a detailed distribution of the General Education requirements in the first-year curriculum, refer to Common First Year General Education Course Curriculum in the Department of Architectural History (years 2-4) Environmental Science Elective: 3 credits Social/Behavioral Science Elective: 3 credits (Non-Western) Humanities Elective: 3 credits.

Students who have declared their major must obtain written permission from the Director of their undergraduate program; students who are undeclared must obtain written permission from the Director of Advising+Academic Support.\\xa0Students who are on warning or in the semester immediately following suspension must obtain additional permission from the Associate Dean of Academics. Electives For students in the School of Architecture the following limits apply to elective courses: •\\xa0Kinesiology (KINE, KLPA)\\xa0courses cannot be used for degree credit. • A maximum of 12-degree credits will be granted for (ROTC) courses. • A maximum of 8-degree credits will be granted for Ensemble Music or Dance. • CR/NC grading option - no more than 1 course per semester, must be counted as an open elective. Part-Time Enrollment Students are ordinarily expected to be enrolled as full-time students.\\xa0 However, students may choose to enroll for a semester or two on a part-time basis.\\xa0 Part-time students are limited to two courses per semester or a maximum of\\xa0six credits.\\xa0 Students may not count more\\xa0than 16 credits taken on a part-time basis toward the degree. Temporary part-time status requires the Associate Dean of Academics and the Director of Advising + Academic Support approval.\\xa0Students registered full-time at the University have until the drop deadline at the beginning of the semester to request conversion of their registration to part-time status. Repeated Courses In accordance with the University policy , when a student earns D+, D, D-, F in a course and opts to take it the second time, both courses and their respective grades will appear on the transcript. Only the highest of the two grades will be used in calculation of the GPA. This GPA adjustment applies only to the first 9 credits of courses that are repeated. This GPA adjustment applies only to cases where both the original and the repeat course are completed at UVA and taken for a letter grade. The repeated course must be attempted no earlier than the Fall 2024 semester. If a student earns C- or higher and chooses to retake the course a second time for credit, both grades will be included in the computation of the grade point average and appear on the student’s transcript. A student may repeat a course only once. Student Owned Computers Undergraduate students are\\xa0required to own a personal computer equipped with specified software when they enter the program. A list of specifications is at http://www.arch.virginia.edu/IT_Resources/Computer_Requirements . Degree Information ^TOP The School of Architecture offers three undergraduate programs of instruction under Architectural History, Architecture, and Urban and Environmental Planning. Supporting course work is offered through the cooperation of departments in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. First-year students take a common core curriculum and declare their major near the end of the second semester. Evaluations of courses and curricula modification are continuing processes in the school. Therefore, the specific degree requirements are subject to change. In each of the degree programs, students should expect that courses may require the purchase of textbooks, software, materials, or equipment. Students may incur costs for field trips. Accreditation The Undergraduate Program in Urban and Environmental Planning is accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board, sponsored jointly by the American Institute of Certified Planners and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning. Bachelor of Architectural History This four-year program is one of the few of its kind in the country. Students are offered a liberal arts education with an emphasis on the study of architectural history. This degree program provides an opportunity to study historic preservation, while offering ample opportunity for interaction with the other disciplines in the school Bachelor of Science\\xa0(Architecture) The undergraduate degree in architecture offers two tracks: the pre-professional track, and the design-thinking track. The pre-professional track is useful for those seeking a foundation in the field of architecture either for continued education in a professional degree program or for employment in design-related fields. The design-thinking track is aimed at students seeking to apply the creative approach of architectural design to broader areas of application. Concerning the pre-professional track, most states consider an accredited degree a requirement to obtaining an architecture license. There are two types of degrees that are accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB): the Bachelor of Architecture, which requires a minimum of five years of study; and the Master of Architecture. The four-year pre-professional degree is not accredited by NAAB. Bachelor of Urban and Environmental Planning The Bachelor of Urban and Environmental Planning is a professional degree recognized by the Planning Accreditation Board. During the final two years of study, the student has a wide range of professional seminars and application courses to choose from in the areas of environmental planning, land use planning, and growth management, and urban development and housing policy. This course of study is designed to develop an integrative knowledge of environmental and community processes, professional skills, and leadership. Grades Audit (AU) Grade Option You may audit courses with the permission of the instructor. Courses successfully taken on an audit basis have the symbol AU (audit) recorded in the grade column of the academic record. As\\xa0no credits or grade points are earned in audited courses, these courses are\\xa0not applicable toward a degree. Instructors have the option of deciding whether students may or may not take their courses on an audit basis. A grade of W is recorded for any student who discontinues the audit after the drop deadline or who fails to meet the instructor’s standards. Credit/No Credit (Grades) Students have the option of receiving a CR (credit) or NC (no credit) in place of regular letter grades for a given course. This option is selected when students register for courses no later than the add deadline. Instructors have the right to deny students permission to take courses on a CR/NC basis. The CR/NC option may be used only for open electives. Grade Changes After a grade has been submitted to UREG (Office of the University Registrar), it cannot be changed without the approval of the Associate Dean of Academics. The Associate Dean of Academics is not authorized by the faculty to change a grade submitted to UREG (Office of the University Registrar) except when an instructor certifies that, due to errors in omission, calculation, or transcription, an incorrect grade was submitted. Under no circumstances can a grade be improved by completing extra work that is in addition to what was communicated in the course syllabus and/or assignments throughout the regular sequence of the semester. The time period allowed for a grade change ends on the first day of class of the subsequent fall or spring semester when the grade was given.\\xa0 If evidence is discovered that a student has violated the integrity of the course, a grade can be changed at the time of the conclusion of this assessment. Requirements Students in the School of Architecture must achieve a minimum grade of C- in required courses. or else be required to repeat the course. Incomplete Grade (IN) A grade of “Incomplete” (IN) is to be given only in cases due to medical emergencies and extenuating family circumstances that necessitate additional time to complete course work.\\xa0 A request for an ‘IN’ is to be submitted to the School of Architecture Registrar prior to the last day of exams\\xa0using the “Incomplete Grade” form approved by the Associate Dean of Academics.\\xa0 An ‘IN’ is not considered an acceptable default final grade and will convert to a grade of ‘F’ five days after the end of the examination period unless an “Incomplete Grade” form is submitted by the course professor with the approval of the Associate Dean of Academics.\\xa0 Documentation supporting the medical excuse is to be provided by a doctor or healthcare provider with the “Incomplete Grade” form. Additionally, a work plan outlining the scope and extended deadline for completion of coursework is due to the Associate Dean of Academics at the time of the form submittal.\\xa0 An approved grade of ‘IN’ will convert automatically to a grade of ‘F’ four weeks after the end of the examination period unless the professor submits a final grade based on the work completed during the additional time or a work plan identifying a specific date for completion of course work.\\xa0 Instructors are not authorized to extend the time for completion of course work without the approval of the Associate Dean of Academics Withdrawals Grading System If a student decides to discontinue a course after the drop deadline, they must withdraw from the class (see note below). Students have eight weeks from the start of the semester to leave a class using this option. This will result in a ‘W’ on the student’s transcript. If, after the withdrawal deadline has passed, a student is enrolled in a class, but has never attended , the student will need to contact the Director of Advising+Academic Support. Failure to do so will result in a failing grade. If a student is failing a course after the withdrawal date and at the end of the semester due to lack of attendance and/or due to not meeting the academic standards of performance set by the professor/SIA of the course, the student will receive an ‘F’ as their final grade. A student is allowed to withdraw from classes in SIS until 11:59 PM on the day of the class withdrawal deadline date, see https://www2.virginia.edu/registrar/calendar.html . To get started, go to the drop tab in the SIS Student Center. Use the DROP transaction for the desired class. When the message is received about withdrawing, click on the “Request Class Withdrawal” link and follow the directions. Intra-University Transfer School of Architecture students wishing to transfer to another School within the University must consult visit the specific school to review deadlines and admission requirements. Students wishing to transfer into the School of Architecture from another School within the University must first meet with the School of Architecture’s Director of Advising and Academic Support to discuss transfer options and course selection. Leaving and Returning to the University Enforced Withdrawal Students may be forced to withdraw from the University for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault that prevents the student from fulfilling the purpose implied by enrollment at the University. Students who are forced to withdraw during a given term will have the notation “Withdrawal Date: MM/DD/YYYY ” entered on their permanent academic records following the semester in which the action occurred. A grade of W (withdrawal)\\xa0will be entered for each course in which the student was registered. Students who have been forced to withdraw must apply for readmission with their dean’s office in the same manner as suspended students. A grade of W cannot be changed. Leave of Absence Students who wish to take a leave of absence for either a semester or a year must apply for such leave by completing the “Leaving the University” form in their SIS Student Center and communicating with the Associate Dean of Academics. A student who wishes to suspend their full-time status for a temporary period of time must request approval from the director of undergraduate studies and the Associate Dean of Academics.\\xa0 As a result, this leave of absence will postpone their expected date of graduation.\\xa0 The student is required to meet with the Associate Dean of Academics as part of the approval process. A student who wishes to take a leave of absence must apply by completing the “Leaving the University” form in their SIS Student Center, no later than one week prior to the beginning of the semester in which the student plans to be on leave.\\xa0 Leave of Absences are approved for a full semester or one academic year. How to Apply for Leave of Absence Email the Associate Dean of Academics,Director of Advising + Academic Support, and the Director of the Program in which you are enrolled, about your intentions on taking a Leave of Absence. If students want to ensure their eligibility for financial aid, they should contact Student Financial Services ( sfs@virginia.edu ) prior to that semester. Contact the International Studies Office (if applicable) at issp@virginia.edu . Fill out the “Leaving the University” e-form in your SIS student center. It is located on the bottom left side of the home page. This process will need to be no later than one week prior to the beginning of the semester in which the student plans to be on leave. Once the e-form has been approved, you will receive an email from the University Registrar’s Office (UREG) that the process has been completed. Students must complete the “Returning to the University” form in their SIS Student Center by March 1st\\xa0for fall + summer semesters, and October 1st\\xa0for the Spring semester,\\xa0(Please see “Returning to the University” section). Students who wish to leave all of their classes during a fall or spring semester at any time after the first day of classes and through the last day of exams must request permission to withdraw from the University by completing the “Leaving the University” form in their SIS Student Center, communicating with their school dean’s office, If the student’s academic dean or designee approves the student’s request to withdraw, ODOS will discuss the proposed withdrawal with the student and, if appropriate, grant final approval. UREG will notify the student once the withdrawal becomes official. Students requesting to withdraw from the University must be aware of the following rules: Students under the age of 18 must give notice to their parents or legal guardians of their intention to withdraw. Evidence of this notice must be provided before a withdrawal request will be approved. Applications for withdrawal must be approved by the student’s academic dean or designee. Undergraduate students may withdraw from the University before the conclusion of a semester, specifically up to the last day of the final examination period. Students may specify on the “Leaving the University” form whether their request to withdraw is for medical reasons. Students approved for withdrawal for medical reasons will need a medical review from the Department of Student Health before they will be approved for readmission to the University; this medical review may take up to three weeks in addition to any deadline set by their school, so students should apply as early as possible when they wish to return to the University. Students who voluntarily withdraw from the University will have the notation “Withdrew: DATE” recorded on their permanent academic record and their official transcript. Undergraduate students will receive a grade of W in all classes. A grade of W cannot be changed. Students wishing to withdraw from classes during Summer Session or J-Term should contact the Office of Summer & Special Academic Programs, 434-924-3371; summer@virginia.edu or januaryterm@virginia.edu . In extreme medical circumstances, documented by a medical professional, a School of Architecture student has one semester in which to petition to the Dean’s Office for a retroactive medical withdrawal. If approved, all grades convert to W’s. Returning to the University Students who wish to return to the University after an absence must be formally readmitted to their last school of enrollment. Readmission requires review and approval by the Associate Dean of Academics, the Department of Student Health (if applicable), the International Studies Office (if applicable), the Office of Student Financial Services (if applicable). Students who withdrew for medical reasons will need a medical review from the Department of Student Health before they will be approved for readmission to the University; this medical review may take up to three weeks in addition to any deadline set by their school, so students should apply as early as possible when they wish to return to the University. Students must complete the “Returning to the University” form in their SIS Student Center by March 1st for the fall + summer semesters,\\xa0and October\\xa01st for the spring semester.\\xa0If students want to ensure their eligibility for financial aid, they should contact Student Financial Services prior to that semester. Students completing the application must include a statement that (1) addresses the student’s readiness to return to the University in light of any serious difficulties, academic suspension, or extenuating circumstances related to his/her absence (e.g. financial, medical, or personal hardship), and (2) outlines the student’s academic plan for his/her remaining semesters. How to Apply for Readmission Email the Associate Dean of Academics and the Director of the Program in which you are enrolled, about your intentions on coming back to the A-School. Email the Director of Advising + Academic Support about your curriculum. Contact the International Studies Office (if applicable) at issp@virginia.edu . If students want to ensure their eligibility for financial aid, they should contact Student Financial Services ( sfs@virginia.edu ) prior to that semester Fill out the “returning to the university” e-form in your SIS student center. It is located on the bottom left side of the home page. This process can be started by March 1st for the fall + summer semesters,\\xa0and October\\xa01st for the spring semester. Once the e-form has been approved, you will receive an email from the University Registrar’s Office (UREG) that the process has been completed. Returning to the University\\xa0is not guaranteed. Majors and Minors Declaring the Major The first year of study in the School of Architecture includes courses in all three undergraduate programs, as well as breadth requirements. During the second semester of the first year, students declare a major in one of the three programs. In the event a particular major or concentration is oversubscribed, admission may be limited. Admission to such programs is based on space availability, academic performance, and additional materials as specified by particular departments. Double Majors According to University policy, students may receive a degree from only one undergraduate school. Undergraduate students who complete the requirements for more than one undergraduate degree program will be awarded a double major. This notation is placed on the transcript but not on the diploma. Students enrolled in the School of Architecture and pursuing a double major must comply with the requirements and policies for both majors. Students not enrolled in the School of Architecture may pursue a second major in the School, provided such a second major is consistent with the policies of their school of enrollment, and the student fulfills all the academic requirements of the major in the School of Architecture. Minors Students enrolled in the School of Architecture and pursuing a minor must comply with the requirements and policies of the school. Students not enrolled in the School of Architecture may pursue a minor in the School of Architecture, provided such a minor is consistent with the policies of their school of enrollment, and the student fulfills all the academic requirements of the minor in the School of Architecture. Public Professional Licensure Disclosure As a member of the State Authorizations Reciprocity Agreement, the University of Virginia (UVA) is authorized to provide curriculum in a distance learning environment to students located in all states in the United States except for California. (34 CFR 668.43(a)(6)& 34 CFR 668.72(n)). Upon completion graduates may be eligible for initial professional licensure in another U.S. state by applying to the licensing board or agency in that state. Please visit the University’s state authorization web pages to make an informed decision regarding which states’ educational requirements for initial licensure are met by this program. (668.43(a)(5) (v)(A) - (C)) Enrolled students who change their current (or mailing) address to a state other than Virginia should update this information immediately in the Student Information System as it may impact their ability to complete internship, practicum, or clinical hours, use Title IV funds, or meet licensure or certification requirements in the new state. (34 CFR 668.402). Student Intellectual Property Ownership of Student Work The School of Architecture follows University Regulations concerning Student Intellectual Property. As a condition of enrollment in the School of Architecture, each Architecture student is deemed to have granted the University a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, or publicly display the student’s coursework, with appropriate credit and attribution, for educational or research purposes only. Any use beyond this limited license requires express written consent of the student. Transfer Credit Residence Requirements and Transfer Credits All three programs normally require four years for completion and a minimum of two years as a full-time student in the School of Architecture. In some cases, summer session study at the University is required of transfer undergraduate applicants accepted by the School of Architecture. Summer Session; ARCH 1031 is a prerequisite for undergraduate transfer students accepted in the department of Architecture entering their second year.\\xa0 ARCH 2011 and ARCH 2021 are prerequisites for undergraduate transfer students accepted by the department of Architecture entering their third year. The School of Architecture grants transfer credit based on an analysis of the content, level, and comparability of the courses taken, the applicability of the courses to the student’s intended major and degree program, the quality of the student’s performance in the courses, and the accreditation of the institution at which the work was completed. The Dean’s Office of the School of Architecture governs the awarding of transfer credit. Students must submit a request for transfer of credit form prior to enrolling in courses for transfer. Transfer credit is allowed only for those courses in which a grade of C or better has been earned. Grades do not transfer and do not affect the student’s cumulative grade point average at the University of Virginia. In no case are transfer credits in excess of 60 granted toward an undergraduate degree in the School of Architecture. The school does not accept pass/fail or credit/no credit courses for transfer credit. In exceptional circumstances, the School of Architecture Dean may waive an admission or performance requirement when, in the dean’s judgment, such action best serves the intent of the program.

Academic Advising Academic Standing Appeals from Students Awards for Academic Excellence College Curriculum Course Rules Degree Information Final Examinations Grades Intra-University Transfers Leaving and Returning to the University Majors and Minors Study Abroad Transfer Credit Academic Advising Academic advising for College undergraduates is the responsibility of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs, the assistant deans in the College (known as Association Deans), and the faculty of the departments within the College.\\xa0 Detailed information about the academic policies and programs of the College, along with links to Departmental homepages is available at http://college.as.virginia.edu . In order to provide every entering student with individual academic advising, the College uses the association system.\\xa0 The student body of the College is partitioned into numerous associations representing either first-year residence halls, Echols Scholars, student-athletes, veterans, or transfer students.\\xa0 Each association has an Association Dean who serves as the academic advising dean throughout a student’s time in the College.\\xa0 The Association Deans are experts regarding the academic policies and rules of the College, as well as the whole range of academic and non-academic resources available to undergraduates in the College.\\xa0 The Association Deans are at the nexus of College advising and thus serve as the principal links between academic advising and the more general concerns of residential life in the College. In addition to Association Deans, upon matriculation every student is assigned a faculty member who serves as the student’s faculty advisor for the first two years.\\xa0 Third-year and fourth-year students are assigned a major department advisor by their major department.\\xa0 Each department and interdepartmental program has a faculty member designated as the Director of the Undergraduate Program who is charged with organizing undergraduate advising in its major.\\xa0 These persons are thoroughly informed about every course offered for undergraduates in their respective fields. A list of the Directors appears online at the College’s website: http://college.as.virginia.edu/ugrad-directors .\\xa0 Midway through each semester, the departments and interdepartmental programs in the College issue a complete description of courses to be offered in the following semester through SIS. Pre-Health Advising While there is no pre-medical minor or concentration at the University, a student planning to apply to medical, dental, or veterinary school should bear the following in mind when planning his/her undergraduate curriculum: Virtually all medical schools require one-year courses with laboratory in chemistry, biology, organic chemistry, and physics. Some schools also list requirements in English, mathematics, and the social sciences. Prospective students in health education should major in the subject that interests them most, as professional schools in the health sciences do not require specific undergraduate majors for admission.\\xa0 However, non-science majors should elect the requisite science courses as they pursue their major, and science majors should elect advanced courses in the humanities and social sciences while they pursue their major.\\xa0 Demonstrating a broad education in the liberal arts to admissions committees is most important.\\xa0 Students should consult with their Association Dean regarding Pre-Health advising.\\xa0 Additional advising is available through the University Career Center. Pre-Law Advising There is no pre-law program in the College, as law schools typically look for high achieving students regardless of their College major.\\xa0 Students interested in law school should take a broad liberal education that develops their writing, critical thinking, and analytical skills.\\xa0 Students should consult with their Association Dean regarding Pre-Law advising.\\xa0 Additional advising is available through the University Career Center. Student Disability Accommodations The University provides a Student Disabilities Access Center for students with diagnosed disabilities.\\xa0 Upon the recommendation of this Center, students with diagnosed disabilities receive appropriate learning accommodations in their courses.\\xa0 More information can be found at https://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu/ .\\xa0 Students diagnosed with a specific language learning disability are referred to the policy outlined below in the Course Rules section. Study Abroad Advising Both world languages and international studies are strong academic programs in the College.\\xa0 Many opportunities exist, some of them unique to this University, for studying abroad.\\xa0 Many students graduating from the College offer some credit from study abroad toward their degrees.\\xa0 Plans for study abroad should be made well in advance of the intended semester of study.\\xa0 Students contemplating study abroad should consult an advisor in the International Studies Office in Minor Hall.\\xa0 A cumulative grade point average of at least 2.500, after the student’s most recent enrollment in Charlottesville, is required to receive credits from studying abroad.\\xa0 Students considering study abroad should bear in mind that no more than 60 credits transferred from other universities, foreign study, advanced placement, and dual enrollment may count toward the 120 credits required for graduation.\\xa0 Students participating in the University’s direct study programs, however, count these credits as having been completed in Charlottesville, i.e. they do not count as transfer credits subject to the 60 credit maximum. Writing Center The Writing Center offers free individual tutoring sessions to students who wish to improve their academic prose.\\xa0 Tutors can help students focus a thesis, organize an argument, fashion a style appropriate to an assignment, and use correct punctuation and grammar.\\xa0 For more information, visit the Writing Center website at http://professionalwriting.as.virginia.edu/welcome-writing-center. Academic Standing After every semester, the Office of the Dean of the College reviews each student’s academic standing and progress toward the degree.\\xa0 If a problem arises, a student’s Association Dean notifies the student by e-mail of important information to be accessed at a secure website.\\xa0 Students are responsible for regularly checking their University email account to obtain\\xa0this information and are subject to the imposition of academic sanctions even if they do not check their email. Academic\\xa0Warning Students who do not meet standards for Good Standing in a fall or spring term incur academic warning.\\xa0 The notation “Academic Warning” is placed on the advising transcript for the semester in which the warning was incurred.\\xa0 A student on\\xa0academic warning is expected to meet with his or her Association Dean no later than the add period of the ensuing semester.\\xa0 Students on academic warning are strongly urged to devote more time to their academic work and are referred to academic support services. Part-time students incur academic warning if they do not attain a 1.800 semester grade point average. Students on academic warning who withdraw or take a leave of absence are eligible to apply for readmission.\\xa0 When readmitted, they are on academic warning\\xa0and must attain Good Standing or face Academic Suspension by virtue of two consecutive semesters of incurring Academic Warning. Good Standing Students are considered to be in good standing at the end of a semester if, in that semester, they have completed at least 12 credits of course work with at least a 1.800 semester grade point average and have no more than one grade below C-.\\xa0 In order to enroll in a fifth semester, students are expected\\xa0to have passed at least 54 credits; to enroll in a seventh semester students are expected to have\\xa0passed at least 84 credits.\\xa0 Students who do not accumulate this number of credits are required to develop and have approved by their Association Dean an academic plan for degree completion, which can include Summer Session courses, additional credits in the following semester, credits at another accredited institution, or taking more than eight full-time semesters to complete their degree.\\xa0 Upon approval of such a plan, students will be permitted to continue to enroll full-time.\\xa0 To remain in good standing by the end of the fourth semester, students must either be in a major or have received permission from the dean’s office to defer the declaration of a major for one semester.\\xa0 Part-time students are considered to be in good standing if they achieve at least a 1.800 grade point average for the semester. Suspension Students are subject to suspension after incurring academic warning in two consecutive semesters or after only one semester if they fail to earn at least nine grade points in that semester.\\xa0 One full fall term and one full spring term must elapse before they are eligible to apply to\\xa0return to the College.\\xa0 After a first suspension, the College considers application for readmission upon presentation of evidence that the difficulties that led to the academic suspension have been overcome (see below).\\xa0 Students under suspension forfeit commitments of financial aid.\\xa0 Students under suspension may not apply transfer credits from other institutions toward their degree from the College.\\xa0 Two semesters must pass before a suspended student may enroll in the University’s Summer Session.\\xa0 A student who receives a second academic suspension may not return to the University. Students to whom notice of suspension has been sent have five business days in which to notify their Association Dean of an intention to appeal.\\xa0 Academic suspension becomes effective upon the Dean’s notification to UREG (University Registrar). That date is determined according to the schedule below or upon notification to UREG (University Registrar) that the suspension has not been overturned on appeal. Following fall semester: Upon notification to UREG (University Registrar) and no later than two days prior to the first day of the spring semester Following spring semester: Upon notification to UREG (University Registrar) and no later than one week prior to the start of Summer Session II Following Summer Session: Upon notification to UREG (University Registrar) and no later than two days prior to the first day of the fall semester When warranted, the Dean is authorized to hold a suspension in abeyance and permit students who would otherwise be suspended to continue under specific conditions.\\xa0 After the semester has concluded, the student’s academic standing will be evaluated and the appropriate academic discipline, if required, will be imposed. Appeals from Students Students may appeal negative decisions about enrollment or general academic policies in the College.\\xa0 Students who believe there is a valid reason for requesting an exception to any of the rules should file a petition to their Association Dean.\\xa0 In many cases, the recommendation of a course instructor or advisor is required on the petition before it is filed.\\xa0 Only students may submit appeals on their own behalf.\\xa0 Any appeal must be made in a timely manner.\\xa0 Students whose petitions for exemption from College rules have been denied by the Association Deans may appeal to the Committee on Faculty Rules (c/o Monroe Hall 101).\\xa0 The Committee consists of faculty members who are not Association Deans and its decision is final.\\xa0 The procedure for grade appeals follows a different path and is discussed below (see the section on Grades).\\xa0 Students should consult with their Association Dean for details about how to appeal a particular decision. Awards for Academic Excellence Dean’s List Full-time students who demonstrate academic excellence while taking a minimum of 15 credits of graded course work are eligible for the Dean’s List of Distinguished Students at the end of each semester.\\xa0 Courses taken on a CR/NC basis are not counted toward the 15-credit minimum.\\xa0 A current minimum grade point average of 3.500 is necessary to be eligible for the Dean’s List.\\xa0 Students on approved reduced course load from the Student Disabilities Access Center (SDAC) who enroll in and pass 7 or more graded credits and earn a 3.500 GPA are eligible for Dean’s List.\\xa0 Any student receiving an F, NC, or U during the semester is not eligible to be on the Dean’s List.\\xa0 The notation “Dean’s List” is posted normally within several weeks after the conclusion of the semester. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa is the nation’s oldest and most prestigious undergraduate honors organization.\\xa0 For more than 200 years, the Society has pursued its mission of celebrating and advocating excellence in the liberal arts and sciences, and its distinctive emblem, a golden key, is widely recognized as a symbol of academic distinction.\\xa0 Students are elected to Phi Beta Kappa for their scholarly attainment in the liberal arts and sciences.\\xa0 Undergraduate members of Phi Beta Kappa are chosen from the top 12 percent of the fourth-year class and the top 4 percent of the third-year class.\\xa0 Students must have earned at least 60 hours at the University of Virginia to be eligible; credits earned at other institutions are not counted in these computations.\\xa0 If you meet these basic criteria you are automatically considered, so it is not necessary to apply.\\xa0 Students chosen for Phi Beta Kappa not only have earned a high grade point average but also have consistently demonstrated scholarship in the liberal arts and sciences.\\xa0 Generally speaking, students elected will have: chosen courses that reflect a scholarly commitment to the breadth and depth of the liberal arts, demonstrated proficiency in challenging advanced-level courses, and carried a challenging course load (usually considered to be 14-15 credit hours most semesters). More specifically, nominees will have taken at least two courses in each of the following areas: humanities, social sciences, and the natural or physical sciences.\\xa0 They will also have taken at least one intermediate course in a foreign language and one course in college-level mathematics, logic, or statistics.\\xa0 All course work must be done in college or university (No AP credits fulfill the criteria).\\xa0 In sum, the students who are elected choose programs that have breadth, depth, and rigor.\\xa0 Extracurricular activities are not taken into account.\\xa0 We hope that students interested in being elected to Phi Beta Kappa will consider these criteria with their advisors as they select their courses throughout their years of study at the University.\\xa0 However, individual consideration is granted each transcript and election is determined by PBK faculty, not by a set of fixed criteria. Questions about Phi Beta Kappa or its University of Virginia chapter should be addressed to Michael F. Suarez, president or Karlin Luedtke, secretary. For general information visit the web site of the National Headquarters of Phi Beta Kappa: https://www.pbk.org Theses and Commencement Honors Degrees with distinction, high distinction, and highest distinction are awarded to students who have a grade point average of 3.400 or higher and have been recommended by the department or interdisciplinary program in which they have completed a Distinguished Majors Program (DMP).\\xa0 Distinguished majors programs require that students submit a written thesis.\\xa0 Most degree programs in the College of Arts & Sciences offer a distinguished majors program.\\xa0 In departments offering thesis courses, non-DMP students may have an opportunity to write a thesis; contact the specific department or program for more information.\\xa0 A degree with distinction (but not high or highest distinction) is awarded to students who have not enrolled in, or who have discontinued, a DMP but who complete their degree with a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.600. College Curriculum All entering first year students, with the exception of Echols Scholars, must complete the Engagements Pathway detailed below.\\xa0 Entering second or third year transfer students complete the Traditional Curriculum.\\xa0 However, starting in fall 2025, transfer students will complete the Disciplines Plus Pathway.\\xa0 Students entering the College through transfer, as well as those who begin their Virginia community college studies this year, will be governed by the College curricular rules outlined in this year’s Undergraduate Record, so long as the student maintains continuous enrollment and enrolls at the University of Virginia within one year of completing their community college program and within four years of when they began their community college enrollment.\\xa0 The application of College curricular rules includes not only the general education pathway specified, but also the number of credits required for graduation (total credits, credits in residence, and credits in the College of Arts and Sciences) and GPA requirements.\\xa0 Transfer students will be governed by the major requirements in place at the time they declare their major, after arriving at the University.\\xa0 Following matriculation, all remaining Literacies and Disciplines requirements (or Competency and Area requirements in the Traditional Curriculum) must be completed at the University of Virginia and must be taken on a graded basis.\\xa0 AP credits from secondary school and transfer credits awarded before UVA matriculation may count toward the Literacies and Disciplines requirements (or Competency and Area requirements in the Traditional Curriculum), with the exception of the Second Writing requirement.\\xa0 Dual-enrollment credit may not be used to meet the First or Second Writing requirement nor the World Languages requirement. THE ENGAGEMENTS PATHWAY The Engagements pathway consists of three parts: the first year Engagement courses (8 credits); the Literacies (variable credits depending on placement); and the Disciplines (21 credits).\\xa0 For more information on these requirements, see https://gened.as.virginia.edu/requirements .\\xa0 Specific course offerings may be found in the Course Catalog and through the Class Search function in the Student Information System (SIS). Engagements Students must take four 2 credit classes in their first year, one each of the following engagement classes. EGMT 1510: Aesthetic Engagement EGMT 1520: Empirical and Scientific Engagement EGMT 1530: Engaging Difference EGMT 1540: Ethical Engagement Students may choose from a variety of specific topics taught under each generic category and may take these courses in any order. Literacies Students must complete each of the following literacies: Rhetoric for the 21st Century , consisting of the First and Second Writing Requirements; World Languages ; and Quantification, Computation, and Data Analysis .\\xa0 The Literacies provide the foundation for successful study in the liberal arts and equip students with the necessary skills and fluencies needed to succeed in a rapidly-transforming world. Rhetoric for the 21st Century: First Writing Requirement Students meet the first writing requirement by successfully completing one of the following five paths: By successfully completing the two-semester Writing and Critical Inquiry Stretch I & II, ENWR 1505/1506. Take this sequence if you scored 560 or below on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section of the SAT or a 21\\xa0or below on the ACT English test. Students in this path should enroll in ENWR 1505 in the fall semester, to be followed by ENWR 1506 in the spring. By successfully completing the two-semester ESL sequence, Writing and Critical Inquiry Stretch I & II for Multi-Lingual Writers, ENWR 1507/1508.\\xa0 Note that this path is for students who are still developing their skills in English as a second language.\\xa0Students required to fulfill the first writing requirement in the ESL path will be identified by the Admissions Office, the Summer Transition Program, The Center for American English Language and Culture, or the Academic and Professional Writing Program. Students in this path should enroll in ENWR 1507 in the fall semester, followed by ENWR 1508 in the spring.\\xa0 Students who are not required to take this sequence but who wish to be considered if spaces are available should contact Claire Chantell for more information. By successfully completing Writing and Critical Inquiry, ENWR 1510, 1520, or 1530. Students in this path (i.e., those scoring between 570 and 740 on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing portion of the SAT or between 22 and 35 on the English portion of the ACT) should enroll in ENWR 1510, 1520, or 1530\\xa0in the fall semester if the first letter of their last name is A through K. Students should also register for fall ENWR 1510, 1520, or 1530 if they play on a varsity team that travels primarily in the spring OR if they are transfer students OR if they are repeating the course. Otherwise, students with last names beginning with L-Z should enroll in ENWR 1510, 1520, or 1530 in the spring semester. By successfully completing a First Writing Requirement Advanced course (ENWR 2510, 2000-level ENLT, or ENCW 2300 or 2600) and submitting an FWR-Plus form to the Writing Program office. This option is available only to students scoring a 740 or above on the SAT’s Evidence-Based Reading and Writing\\xa0test or\\xa0a 36 on the ACT English test. By enrolling in the Echols Scholars program. Courses taken to fulfill the First Writing Requirement cannot also satisfy the Second Writing Requirement or any Disciplines (or Area) requirement. Rhetoric for the 21st Century: Second Writing Requirement All students, except Echols Scholars, must complete at\\xa0UVA a second writing requirement course with a grade of C- or better.\\xa0 Second writing requirement courses are 3 or 4 credit writing intensive courses found in many departments across the College.\\xa0 A course in a school other than the College, advanced placement credit, advanced standing, dual enrollment credit, or credit transferred from another university will not satisfy this requirement.\\xa0 A course must have at least two writing assignments in English totaling 20 pages or more, exclusive of quizzes and final examinations, and a student/faculty ratio no greater than 30/1 to qualify as a second writing requirement course. Although it is not advised, a student may take a course that meets the second writing requirement before or during the semester that he or she completes the first writing requirement.\\xa0 However, completing the second writing requirement neither exempts a student from, nor fulfills, the first writing requirement.\\xa0 A course that satisfies the second writing requirement may simultaneously count toward a student’s major or minor program or toward a Disciplines requirement.\\xa0 A second writing requirement course may also count for up to two area requirements. A course that is not designated in the College Catalog as a second writing course may fulfill the requirement when an instructor certifies that the course meets the standards for a second writing requirement course noted above.\\xa0 In this case, a student must file a second writing requirement completion form along with a syllabus of the completed course.\\xa0 The College Registrar will forward the documentation to the administrative chair of the Committee on Educational Policy and Curriculum for a final determination.\\xa0 The completion form is available online and in Monroe Hall. World Languages Language is not simply a means to communicate, but also an avenue for insights into other cultures.\\xa0 Many students also discover that learning a second language improves their understanding of English and broadens their awareness of an increasingly diverse America.\\xa0 Students can meet the World Languages requirement by successfully completing one of the following courses of action: Earn exemption by placing beyond the intermediate level (usually 2020) by examination Take four semesters of the same language (14 to 16 credits depending on the language) in the proper sequence typically finishing at the 2020 (advanced intermediate) level After placement, complete the remaining courses in the sequence up to the fourth semester (usually 2020) Placement in a language sequence is by SAT II Subject Test score, Advanced Placement (AP) Exam, Higher-level International Baccalaureate Exam, or a departmental placement test.\\xa0 Consult the World Language Placement Index ( http://college.as.virginia.edu/fl-placement-index ) for specific departmental standards.\\xa0 Students must follow the department’s recommendations in the completion of the World Languages requirement.\\xa0 Once placement occurs, the World Languages requirement is fulfilled by the completion of each course in sequence.\\xa0 Credit for introductory language courses is disallowed if it duplicates world\\xa0language credits offered for admission to the College. Students may be exempted from world languages not taught in the College upon certification by a faculty member or outside examiner designated by the College.\\xa0 Students diagnosed with a specific language learning disability should contact their Association Dean.\\xa0 The policy is outlined below in the Course Rules section. Quantification, Computation, and Data Analysis The Quantification, Computation, and Data Analysis literacy enables students to apply mathematical skills to understand and solve real world problems.\\xa0 Students fulfill this requirement by completing two courses (6+ credits) in qualifying courses in statistics, mathematics, data analysis or logic that address at least some of the following: Theoretical concepts and structures of mathematics and statistics including, but not limited to, pure mathematics, logic, and theoretical statistics. Manipulation and interpretation of mathematical expressions. Application of computational and analytical methods in order to manipulate, organize, summarize, and evaluate quantitative information and experience. Theoretical and/or practical interpretation and communication of data in order to solve real-world problems. These courses may be found in multiple departments across the College including Anthropology, Mathematics, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, and Statistics.\\xa0 Qualifying courses may be found through the Class Search function in the Student Information System (SIS). Disciplines Disciplines courses provide students with a breadth of approaches to intellectual inquiry from across the College curriculum.\\xa0 Students must complete one course (3 or 4 credits each) from at least six different departments in each of the following seven categories. Artistic, Interpretive, and Philosophical Inquiry The Chemical, Mathematical, and Physical Universe Cultures and Societies of the World Historical Perspectives Living Systems Science and Society Social and Economic Systems Courses that fulfill each of the categories may be found across multiple departments and many courses count toward two different Disciplines categories.\\xa0 When a course counts toward two different Disciplines, students may choose which category the course fulfills.\\xa0 Qualifying courses may be found through the Class Search function in the Student Information System (SIS). Modification for the B.S. Degree Students enrolled in a Bachelor of Science program may elect to take 9 credits in one or two of the following three categories (rather than 3 credits in each): The Chemical, Mathematical, and Physical Universe, Living Systems, and Science and Society .\\xa0 They may double-count one course (3 credits) towards fulfilling two of the following three categories: Cultures and Societies of the World, Historical Perspectives, and Social and Economic Systems .\\xa0 The course in question must be listed in both categories for which it will count.\\xa0 Bachelor of Science students must fulfill the Disciplines requirement by taking courses in five different departments. The Disciplines Plus Pathway for Transfer Students (beginning in Fall 2025) Students in the Disciplines Plus Pathway complete the same Literacies and Disciplines as students in the Engagements Pathway.\\xa0 However, instead of taking the first year Engagements courses (8 credits total), students complete two\\xa0additional courses (6\\xa0credits) in the Disciplines beyond the seven required as follows: One additional course in Artistic, Interpretive, and Philosophical Inquiry One additional course in Cultures and Societies of the World OR Historical Perspectives OR Social and Economic Systems OR The Chemical, Mathematical, and Physical Universe OR Living Systems OR Science and Society Modification for the B.S. Degree Students enrolled in a Bachelor of Science program may elect to take 12 credits in one or two of the following three categories (rather than 3 credit in each plus an additional category requirement): The Chemical, Mathematical, and Physical Universe, Living Systems, and Science and Society.\\xa0 They may double-count one course (3 credits) toward fulfilling two of the following three categories: Cultures, and Societies of the World, Historical Perspectives, Social and Economic Systems.\\xa0 The course in question must be listed in both categories for which it will count.\\xa0 Bachelor of Science students must fulfill the Disciplines requirement by taking courses in six different departments. THE TRADITIONAL CURRICULUM Transfer students complete the Traditional Curriculum consisting of Competency and Area Requirements (but note the change above beginning in fall 2025).\\xa0 Competency requirements consist of the First and Second Writing requirements and the World Languages requirements listed above in the Literacies.\\xa0 Area requirements ensure that students have the background and breadth for further learning in a variety of disciplines.\\xa0 Students explore a wide range of disciplines, points of view, and modes of inquiry by earning the proper number of credits from courses taken in each of five different academic areas: Historical Studies, Humanities, Natural Science and Mathematics, Non-Western Perspectives, and Social Sciences. Historical Studies (3 credits) You must pass at least one course worth 3 credits or more either from the History Department or from a class determined by the faculty to be substantially historical.\\xa0 Qualifying courses can be found in the SIS Course Catalog.\\xa0 Courses taken to fulfill the Historical Studies Area Requirement may also count toward fulfilling one other Area Requirement. Humanities (6 credits) Student must pass at least one course worth 3 credits or more from two of the following groups of departments and programs: Fine Arts: Anthropology (ANTH): ANTH 2370 only Art History (ARTH): all classes Studio Art (ARTS): all classes Drama (DRAM): all classes English (ENCW only): all classes with the ENCW mnemonic Music (MUSI): all MUSI classes except for MUSI 1600, 1620, 2600, and 3600; Music performance classes (MUBN, MUEN, and MUPF) do NOT fill this requirement Media Studies (MDST): MDST 3100 only Architectural History (ARH): ARH 1000, 1010, 1020, 1700, 3102, 3203 and 3701 only Architecture (ARCH): ARCH 1010 Literature: AMST 2300 Classics (CLAS): all classes Comparative Literature (CLPT): all classes East Asian Language and Cultures (EALC): all classes East Asian Studies (EAST): all classes English (ENGL): all ENGL classes except ENGL 1910 (not ENCW or ENWR classes or ENSP 1600).

AP Credit If a course for which AP credits have been awarded is repeated at the University, the AP credits are disallowed.\\xa0 The repeated course is posted, with its credits counting toward graduation and its grade included in the computation of the grade point average. Changes in Schedule Changes in students’ class schedules are made via SIS.\\xa0 If admission to a course requires the instructor’s permission, students should add their name to the instructor’s permission list and wait for an invitation to join the class.\\xa0 Note that being on a permission list does not guarantee that a student will be offered a space in a class.\\xa0 Students may add and drop courses through the deadlines stated in the current Schedule of Classes. Compliance with College Regulations Students are held responsible for selecting their courses in accordance with the course restrictions and policies printed in this Record, on the College of Arts & Sciences web pages, and in advising material distributed by departments.\\xa0 Only after the approval of the department and the\\xa0Dean’s office has been obtained in the form of a petition may a student enroll in a course that does not comply with the College’s regulations. Course Absence Regulations Regular attendance in classes is a vital part of the educational process.\\xa0 At the University of Virginia each student is expected to accept the responsibility of attending classes regularly and promptly.\\xa0 Instructors are encouraged to state their policy on attendance to their classes; they may refer any student whose attendance record they consider unsatisfactory to the dean. The Dean of the College will follow faculty requests to confer with students who are absent from classes too often and, when necessary, will impose academic discipline upon these students, either when recommended by instructors or deemed necessary by his or her office.\\xa0 Absences traditionally excused are those that occur because of hospitalization, serious illness, death in a student’s family, important religious holidays, or authorized University activities (field trips, University-sponsored athletic events, or the like).\\xa0 Students anticipating the need to be absent are expected to consult with the instructor promptly.\\xa0 The instructor is not obligated to allow students to make up missed work; it is the instructor’s decision, not the dean’s, whether students may be allowed such a privilege.\\xa0 Neither the Department of Student Health nor the dean’s office issues excuses for class absence or for missed quizzes.\\xa0 Only when students are unable to contact instructors themselves (e.g., debilitating illness, leaving town suddenly for family emergencies, protracted absences) do the Association Deans send notification to instructors; otherwise, it is the student’s responsibility to consult directly with the instructor regarding absence from class.\\xa0 Excuses for absences from final examinations must come only from the dean’s office. Course Enrollment Deadlines The College takes seriously all deadlines related to course enrollment.\\xa0 Students are responsible for being aware of the well-publicized dates each semester for adding, dropping or withdrawing from a course, or for changing the grading basis of a course.\\xa0 Students who miss these deadlines may be subject to enrollment penalties.\\xa0 Any student who wishes to appeal any penalty attached to missed deadlines must see their Association Dean.\\xa0 Students may not register late in the College and enroll in classes after the add deadline for the semester. Course Load Special permission is required to register for fewer than 12 credits or more than 18\\xa0credits each semester.\\xa0 With the exception of students who have SDAC approval, any\\xa0student who completes fewer than 12 credits incurs academic warning\\xa0(see Academic Standing above).\\xa0 Students who\\xa0enroll in no courses have their registration terminated.\\xa0 Students in their final semester prior to graduation whose petition for a reduced course load has been approved do not incur academic warning. Full time students enroll with the expectation of completing their degrees in no more than eight semesters, proportionally fewer if they enter as transfer students.\\xa0 When extenuating circumstances interfere, students may take up to nine full-time semesters with permission of their Association Dean.\\xa0 Students who fail to finish their degree programs in the allotted number of semesters allowed may complete their course work in the Summer Session, through part-time enrollment, or, with prior permission, at another accredited institution. Courses Taken at Other Institutions Students who wish to take academic courses at another institution after matriculation at the University should confer with\\xa0the dean and the relevant undergraduate\\xa0department that offers corresponding work at the University to confirm that classes will transfer.\\xa0 Permission is not granted unless students have at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average (2.500 for courses taken abroad).\\xa0 After matriculation at the University, students may not fulfill general education requirements with transfer courses, with the exception of world language courses taught in the target country.\\xa0 Courses taught in the UVA direct credit study abroad programs are accepted as University courses and students receive letter grades.\\xa0 Subject to the above, work completed elsewhere with a grade of C or better is transferred in credits only; letter grades do not appear on the University’s official records.\\xa0 Students will receive no more, and may receive fewer, than the number of credits earned at the host institution.\\xa0 Of the 120 credits required for graduation, at least 60 must be taken at the University of Virginia.\\xa0 Twelve or more credits attempted in a single semester for work at another institution, including at a foreign institution, will constitute one of the eight semesters allotted for full-time study in the College. Discontinuing a Course Students may not be removed from a course due to lack of skills or knowledge unless these requirements are identified in the course prerequisites.\\xa0 Students who decide to discontinue a course in which they have enrolled must use SIS to drop the course within the well-publicized deadlines.\\xa0 Students who fail to revise their list of current courses by using SIS within the deadlines become subject to penalties determined by the dean.\\xa0 Students who fail to appear for the\\xa0first class meeting and who have not made arrangements with the instructor are subject to disenrollment from the course.\\xa0 However, it is the student’s responsibility to drop the course via SIS by the drop deadline.\\xa0 After the drop period, students in the College may withdraw from a course in SIS with a grade of W until eight weeks from the first day of the semester.\\xa0 After this point, students must either complete the course or, with the instructor’s endorsement, submit a request for an incomplete to the dean’s office.\\xa0 Students who discontinue a course at any point without complying with the proper procedure receive a failing grade. For year-long College courses, the deadlines to add and drop are those for the first semester, and the withdrawal deadline is that of the second semester. Dual Enrollment If a course for which dual enrollment credits have been awarded is repeated, the dual enrollment credits are disallowed.\\xa0 The repeated course is posted, with its credits counting toward graduation and its grade included in the computation of the grade point average.\\xa0 Dual enrollment credit may not be used to fulfill the literacies or the competency requirements. Exclusion From Classes A student who is making no real progress in a class, or whose behavior is detracting from the class, may be excluded from that course by the dean with a grade of W or F.\\xa0 Students have five calendar days following written notification of this exclusion in which to appeal.\\xa0 Until the final disposition of the appeal, the student is considered enrolled in the class. Graduate-Level Courses Undergraduates may not enroll in courses numbered 6000 and higher without the prior written approval of the Department and the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences or the corresponding School in the University.\\xa0 They must also receive approval from the College.\\xa0 Students use the “6000 Form”, available on the College website, to make a request for enrollment in these graduate courses. Independent Study and Interdisciplinary Courses Students who wish to do independent study must do so under the auspices of a Departmental or interdisciplinary degree program in the College.\\xa0 Interdisciplinary courses taught under the INST subject area count among the 12\\xa0non-College credits students may include in the 120 total credits required for a College degree.\\xa0 No more than three INST credits may count toward the degree. Intra-University or Non-College Courses Students are subject to the course enrollment deadlines of the School in which the course is being offered.\\xa0 As such, College students taking courses in other schools of the University must follow that School’s deadlines for dropping, adding, and withdrawing from a class.\\xa0 Similarly, non-College students must abide by the College’s enrollment deadlines when taking College courses.\\xa0 Non-College students who seek to withdraw from a College class after the College’s deadline are to consult with the dean of the School of their enrollment.\\xa0 The student remains in the class unless that Dean’s office authorizes a late withdrawal. For students offering the minimum 120 credits for the B.A. or B.S., at least 108\\xa0must be College (or College-equivalent) courses; thus, no more than 12 credits from other schools of the University may be applied toward the B.A degree.\\xa0 Elective courses in the schools of Commerce, Engineering, Education, Architecture, Leadership and Public Policy, and Nursing may count towards the 12\\xa0outside credits.\\xa0 College students may not take any courses from the School of Continuing and Professional Studies and thus may not count any such courses toward their degree.\\xa0 By faculty approval, the following courses are considered College-equivalent and may be applied toward general education requirements:\\xa0ARH courses; ARCH 1010; MSE 2010; and PHS courses. The following courses may not count toward general education requirements\\xa0but are considered College-equivalent:\\xa0ARCH 1020; CS courses;\\xa0STS 3500;\\xa0USEM 1580 and 2580 (USEM 1570 and 2570 courses are non-College courses). The following courses may count as College equivalent courses only when a student completes the requisite program of study: PLAN courses below 5000 if the minor in Urban and Environmental Planning is completed; 12 credits of advisor-approved electives outside the College when a student completes the major in Global Studies with a concentration in Environments and Sustainability.\\xa0 Fourth-year College students who have been admitted to the Masters in Public Policy (M.P.P.) program in the Batten School of Public Policy and Leadership may count up to 12 credits of Batten School courses taken in the fourth year as College equivalent credits. Students in the special education track of the B.A.-M.T. Program are permitted to count the following additional six credits of Education\\xa0School courses as College-equivalent: EDIS 3020 or EDIS 5000 and one of the following courses: EDIS 5100, 5110, 5120, or 5150. In addition to courses taught by other schools in the University, the following are considered non-College courses and may not count toward the 108\\xa0College credits of the 120 credits total needed for the B.A.: all ELA and INST courses (only offered on a CR/NC grading option); all KINE courses; all KLPA courses; all PLSK courses; all ROTC courses–AIRS, MISC, NASC; all SEMS courses; all UNST courses; and all USEM 1570 and 2570 courses. Language Learning Disability Accommodations Following a diagnosis from the Student Disabilities Access Center (SDAC) and upon receipt of the coordinator’s recommendation, the student’s Association Dean may authorize the modification of the World Languages requirement and so notify the student in writing.\\xa0 Grades already earned in world language classes will continue to appear on the transcript.\\xa0 For the semester in which the requirement is modified, a failing grade will be converted to NC (no credit).\\xa0 Also, if a student is diagnosed with a language learning disability, a failing grade received in the semester when the student was referred to SDAC for testing, or the student with a prior diagnosis identified him/herself to the SDAC, will be converted to NC. If the withdrawal deadline has not passed, the student may withdraw thus receiving a W in the course. Therefore, a student experiencing exceptional difficulty in a world language class should: Consult immediately with the appropriate language course coordinator.\\xa0 The name of the coordinator may be obtained from the relevant world languages department. Undergo testing. Consult the Student Disabilities Access Center (SDAC), located in the\\xa0Student Health and Wellness building\\xa0and present either a prior diagnosis or discuss testing to be undertaken.\\xa0 The center will determine if a previous diagnosis was made according to acceptable standards and within three years of admission to the University or anytime thereafter.\\xa0 In the absence of an acceptable prior diagnosis, the SDAC staff will counsel the student regarding undergoing neuropsychological testing for the purposes of establishing a diagnosis.\\xa0 The SDAC will refer the student to approved testing agencies both within the University and the community. The student bears the cost of such testing. If a student has received a diagnosis of a learning disability deemed acceptable to the University’s SDAC and can document unsuccessful efforts to learn another language at an accredited institution, the student may confer with his or her Association Dean regarding modification of the foreign language requirement.\\xa0 A petition from the student will be reviewed by the College’s Disability Accommodations Committee. Request accommodation.\\xa0 If testing confirms a learning disability that adversely affects the learning of another language, the SDAC will suggest possible accommodations in the language classroom (e.g., extended time in class tests, de-emphasized oral or aural components, extra tutorial assistance).\\xa0 The student then takes the accommodation request to both the instructor and the language coordinator.\\xa0 The instructor and the coordinator will inform the student of the accommodations the student will receive in the class.\\xa0 The coordinator will notify the student’s Association Dean of the accommodations in writing.\\xa0 Ideally, accommodations should be in place prior to the student’s enrolling in the course. Enroll with accommodations.\\xa0 The coordinator reviews the student’s progress after six weeks. If the student is able to succeed, the student continues to take courses with accommodations until the foreign language sequence is completed. If the department finds that accommodations prove unworkable despite the student’s maximum effort, the coordinator may recommend in writing to the student’s Association Dean that the world languages requirement be modified.\\xa0 Modification is to be recommended only after proper accommodation procedures have failed. Substitute courses upon modification.\\xa0 The student will be required to take the appropriate number of substitute courses to fulfill the world languages requirement.\\xa0 These courses are to deal (in English) with the culture or literature of a non-English speaking people, or with the history or description of language.\\xa0 The substitute courses should form a cohesive cluster focussed on one language area, either continuing the work begun in the language class or choosing a new area.\\xa0 The substitute courses should be drawn primarily from world literature in translation courses (course mnemonic ending with TR, e.g.; CHTR, FRTR, GETR, ITTR, JPTR, PETR, POTR, RUTR etc.); classics (CLAS); those classes from anthropology, history, religion, or other departments that deal exclusively with a specific non-English speaking country or culture; or linguistics (LNGS).\\xa0 The student is to seek his or her dean’s prior approval for each substitute course.\\xa0 Substitute courses may not be applied toward the first major or toward either Disciplines or Area requirements.\\xa0 They may count toward the second writing requirement.\\xa0 All substitute courses must be taken for a grade. Maximum Credit Hour Limits To ensure breadth and depth in each student’s degree program, the following areas of study have restrictions on the number of credits that may be applied toward the B.A. degree: Dance Performance (DANC): 8 credits Interdisciplinary Studies (INST): 3 credits (and no more than two classes) Language House courses: 2 credits Music Performance (MUBD, MUEN, MUPF): up to 16 credits, if at least 8 credits are at the 3000 level and above (students completing a Distinguished Majors Program in Music may apply up to 20 credits) Personal Skills (PLSK): 2 credits Physical Education (KLPA, formerly KINE): 2 credits ROTC courses (AIRS, MISC, NASC): 12 credits University Seminars (USEM): 8 credits (only one course may be taken per semester) Part-Time Enrollment College students are ordinarily expected to be enrolled as full-time students.\\xa0 However, students may choose to enroll for a semester or two on a part-time basis.\\xa0 Part-time students are limited to a maximum of six credits per semester.\\xa0 Students may not count more\\xa0than 16 credits taken on a part-time basis toward the degree.\\xa0 College students registered full time at the University have until the drop deadline at the beginning of the semester to request conversion of their enrollment to part-time status. Repeated Courses Two essentially different courses offered under the same course number may both be counted for degree credit upon the written recommendation of the director of undergraduate studies in the department concerned.\\xa0 Two essentially identical courses, whether under the same course number or not, may not both be counted for degree credit.\\xa0 If a course is passed and repeated, only the first grade received is entered in the computation of grade point average.\\xa0 However, only the repeated course counts toward the 120 credits required for graduation.\\xa0 Both the original and repeated course, and their grades, appear on the student’s transcript.\\xa0 If a course is failed and repeated, both courses and grades appear on the transcript, the repeated course with a passing grade counts toward the 120 credits, and both courses are computed in the grade point average.\\xa0 All Fs are calculated into the student’s grade point average. Simultaneous Counting of Courses and Cross-listed Courses A course that counts toward two Discipline\\xa0requirements may only satisfy one of those Disciplines for an individual student, but it may satisfy the Second Writing Literacy requirement.\\xa0 For transfer students in the Traditional Curriculum, one course may simultaneously meet two area requirements; it may also satisfy the Second Writing requirement. Courses taken to fulfill disciplines, area or second writing requirements may be counted toward a first or second major or toward a minor. Simultaneous Enrollments Students may not enroll in two courses that meet at the same time or that overlap in time.\\xa0 In the rare case where this is necessary, students must obtain the written approval of both instructors and their Association Dean.\\xa0 The faculty have the authority to require 100 percent attendance and participation in scheduled courses.\\xa0 The dean’s office, upon request from a faculty member, may disenroll a student, with a grade of W, from one of the courses. Transfer Credit If a course taken elsewhere and transferred to the University is repeated and passed at the University, only the credits awarded for the transferred course count toward the 120 credits required for graduation.\\xa0 The course repeated at the University does appear on the student’s transcript, but the grade earned does not enter into computation of the grade point average, nor do the credits earned count toward the 120 required for graduation. Credit awarded as “X000T” credit will not count towards fulfillment of any general education requirements for entering first-year students.\\xa0 External transfer students may still apply X000T credit to fulfill area and competency requirements (literacies and disciplines requirements starting in fall 2025. Degree Information Bachelor of Arts The College offers a Bachelor of Arts degree\\xa0which provides students with a foundational liberal education of significant breadth and depth that allows students to pursue meaningful vocation, engaged citizenship, and intelligent self-development beyond their undergraduate years.\\xa0 The College has more than fifty different majors in the Arts, Humanities, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.\\xa0 The College also offers over thirty different minors.\\xa0 To earn a B.A. or B.S., a student must present 120 credits which satisfy general education requirements (see the section above on the College Curriculum), and the requirements for one major (see the section below on Majors and Minors).\\xa0 For specific information about each major and minor subject see the section “Departments/Programs” elsewhere in the College’s section of this Record.\\xa0 All of the requirements for the B.A. or the B.S. must be taken on a graded basis. Bachelor of Arts with Honors The purpose of the baccalaureate degree with honors is to enable students of special ability and interest in their third and fourth years to pursue a course of independent study under the guidance of a department faculty.\\xa0 Honors students devote their time primarily to their chosen subjects for two years, during which they read independently in that field and participate in tutorials and seminars conducted by their departmental tutors. Honors program students are evaluated by visiting examiners from other colleges and universities.\\xa0 Depending upon this evaluation, they may receive degrees with “honors,” “high honors,” or “highest honors” as the only grades for two years of work.\\xa0 It is also possible they may be recommended for no degree, or for an ordinary Bachelor of Arts degree.\\xa0 At present, the Woodrow Wilson Department of Politics is the only department with an Honors program.\\xa0 Further information may be obtained from the Director of Undergraduate Programs in Politics regarding its Honors program. Bachelor of Science The College offers a more rigorous Bachelor of Science degree for those students intending to pursue graduate study in one of the Natural Sciences or Statistics.\\xa0 The requirements for the B.S.\\xa0in Astronomy-Physics, Behavioral Neuroscience, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, Physics, and Statistics are included in the appropriate departmental descriptions (see Departments and Programs). Curricular Requirements for Students Resuming their Education Students who discontinued their undergraduate education in the College and wish to resume it after a significant lapse of time are subject either to current curricular requirements or the general education curriculum in place when they matriculated to the University.\\xa0 Students are subject to current major requirements at the time of readmission to the College.\\xa0 The College\\xa0consults with the major department, determines the student’s remaining requirements, and informs the student of these requirements before readmission to the College.\\xa0 Students wishing to resume their undergraduate education should contact the College of Arts and Sciences Advising\\xa0Office in Monroe Hall. Degree Applications To receive a degree, students must comply with the well-publicized procedures administered by the College Registrar, whose office is in Monroe Hall 138.\\xa0 The application process for May graduation begins in October, with the final deadline to file a May degree application falling in December, before winter break.\\xa0 The application deadline for August graduation is July 1; for December graduation the deadline is October 1.\\xa0 Students who miss a deadline may apply for the subsequent graduation and must register for the semester in which it occurs. Degree Requirements For graduation from the College with a B.A. or B.S., candidates for the degree must have satisfied all general education and major requirements (see section above on the College Curriculum and the section below on Majors and Minors).\\xa0 Echols Scholars are exempt from general education requirements.\\xa0 In addition, candidates must have passed and offer for a degree a minimum of 120 credits of approved courses, of which at least 96 must be passed on a graded basis.\\xa0 Among the 120 credits, at least 108 must be College or College-equivalent credits.\\xa0 60 of the 120 credits must be taken at the University of Virginia.\\xa0 Candidates must have made a grade point average of at least 2.000 on all graded courses taken in the College or elsewhere in the University and offered for a degree.\\xa0 The College does not award second degrees.\\xa0 Students who earned a baccalaureate degree at UVA or at another institution are not eligible to receive a second undergraduate degree from the College. Echols Scholars Program About 250 accomplished students are invited to join the Echols Scholars Program at the time of their admission into the University.\\xa0 The program combines a stimulating residential environment with special academic advising for first-year students.\\xa0 Echols scholars are exempt from the College’s general education requirements.\\xa0 First-year Echols scholars and all Echols scholars who maintain a 3.000 or higher cumulative grade point average have priority registration for courses and the option of declaring an Echols major.\\xa0 Students with unusually strong academic records after their first year may apply for admission to the Echols Scholars Program.\\xa0 Professor Karl Shuve\\xa0is the Director and Dean Sarah Cole is the Assistant Director of the Echols Scholars Program. Eligibility and Completion of Degree Requirements Students in the College of Arts & Sciences, who, while studying elsewhere, declare a major there, are considered to have transferred from the University.\\xa0 If they seek to return to the College, they must apply as transfer students via the Office of Admission.\\xa0 Students who have completed the requirements for a baccalaureate degree elsewhere may not enroll in a degree program in the College.\\xa0 A student who has received a baccalaureate degree cannot submit any courses offered for that degree toward another degree in the University.\\xa0 Students are subject to the general education requirements in effect during the academic year when they first enter the University.\\xa0 Students are subject to the requirements for the major in effect during the semester in which they declare the major. Posthumous Degrees Upon recommendation of the department in which the student was majoring, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may make a posthumous award of the degree the student was pursuing, if the student had earned at least 90 credits and was registered at the University within twelve months at the time of death.\\xa0 Eligibility for posthumous degrees extends to students enrolled in B.A. and B.S. programs. Residency Requirement The minimum residency requirement for a degree is two academic years.\\xa0 The last year of candidacy must be spent\\xa0at this University, and courses offered in the major for the degree must be completed at the University unless written permission is obtained from the department or interdepartmental program concerned. Time Frame for Degree Completion The expectation is that students complete a\\xa0degree program in four academic years/eight semesters of full-time enrollment (excluding Summer Session and January Term enrollment), proportionately fewer if they enter as transfer students.\\xa0 In order to remain on track to graduate in four years, students are expected to\\xa0have completed 54 credits to enroll in a fifth semester of full time study and 84 credits to enroll in a seventh semester of full time study.\\xa0 When extenuating circumstances interfere, students may take up to nine full-time semesters with permission of their Association Dean.\\xa0 Students who find themselves needing a ninth semester may consult with their Association Dean as early as the end of their fourth semester.\\xa0 Twelve or more credits attempted in a single semester for work at another institution, including study abroad, will constitute one of the semesters allotted for full-time enrollment\\xa0in the College.\\xa0 Students who fail to finish their degree programs\\xa0in the allotted number of semesters may complete their coursework in the Summer Session or January term, through part-time enrollment, or, with prior permission, at another accredited institution. Visiting Students With permission, students may be\\xa0admitted to non-degree, one-year enrollment as special students in the College.\\xa0 The purpose is to provide graduates of four-year institutions, with strong academic records, an opportunity to prepare themselves for graduate work in Arts & Sciences.\\xa0 This program is not meant for students who wish to apply to medical school, law school, business school or any other professional program of study.\\xa0 Written requests for admission as a special student should be addressed to Assistant Dean Mark Hadley, Monroe Hall 101, University of Virginia, P.O. Box 400133, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4133, and should be submitted by July 1\\xa0for admission for the fall semester.\\xa0 Such requests should include a letter of endorsement from the appropriate College\\xa0departmental graduate program director and an official copy of the student’s transcript. Special students are not accepted for the spring semester.\\xa0 No financial aid is available for visiting students. Admission as a visiting student does not imply or guarantee admission to a degree program in an undergraduate or graduate school of the University.\\xa0 Admission to undergraduate schools may be offered only by the dean of undergraduate admission.\\xa0 Admission to graduate programs may be made only by the dean of graduate admission of each individual graduate school. Final Examinations Final examinations are given in regularly scheduled courses during a designated period of time at the end of each semester.\\xa0 Final exams in courses may be given only at the times listed on the UREG (Office of the University Registrar) website.\\xa0 Examinations in courses not fitting the regular class times are scheduled by UREG in consultation with the instructor.\\xa0 Faculty members are not authorized to change the announced times of their examinations.\\xa0 Such changes may be authorized only by the dean’s office, and then only for compelling reasons.\\xa0 All students must have the opportunity to take the exam at the time announced on the UREG website. Students are not permitted to take a final exam before its regularly scheduled time.\\xa0 When a student has three exams scheduled over two consecutive days, the student may request a postponement of one of their exams.\\xa0 The student must file the exam postponement request, endorsed by the instructor of the course, no later than one week prior to the first day of the examination period.\\xa0 When other genuinely serious and extenuating circumstances exist, the Association Deans may authorize student requests, when endorsed by a faculty member, to reschedule a final examination either later in the exam period by filing an examination postponement form, or, by filing an extension of time form, to take the exam within four weeks after the exam period.\\xa0 These forms are available in the Office of the Dean of the College in Monroe Hall.\\xa0 Unexcused absence from a final examination results in an automatic grade of F in the course. Grades Credit/No Credit Grades Students have the option of receiving the grades CR (credit) or NC (no credit) in place of the regular grades A through F for a given course.\\xa0 This option is taken at the time the student registers for the course and no later than the add deadline.\\xa0 An instructor has the right to deny students permission to take his or her course on a CR/NC basis.\\xa0 If this occurs, students may either change back to the regular grading option or they may drop the course entirely.\\xa0 Courses taken for CR/NC may not be used for any major, minor, competency or area requirements.\\xa0 It is the student’s responsibility to confirm with the instructor the minimum academic level of achievement for the grade of CR. No more than two courses may be taken on a CR/NC basis in any semester or in summer session exclusive of physical education courses.\\xa0 A maximum of 24 credits of CR/NC courses may be used toward a degree.\\xa0 Second-year transfer students are permitted to submit up to 18 credits of CR/NC work toward a degree; third-year transfer students, may submit a maximum 12 credits of CR/NC work.\\xa0 Students may not repeat a course originally taken on a graded basis on a CR/NC basis.\\xa0 If this should occur, the credits in the CR/NC course would not count toward graduation.\\xa0 The deadline for selecting the CR/NC option is the same as the add deadline, and requests for exceptions to the deadline are seldom granted. Grade Appeals and Classroom Issues Students who wish to appeal a grade or other classroom issue must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the course.\\xa0 Absent a satisfactory outcome, the student may appeal to the relevant department chair or program director.\\xa0 If this path proves unsuccessful in the resolution of the matter, the student may appeal to a Committee of Associate Deans in the College of Arts & Sciences.\\xa0 The written appeal should be addressed to the Committee on Final Grade Appeals and mailed to or dropped off with the College of Arts & Sciences, Monroe Hall, P.O. Box 400133.\\xa0 Grade appeals may only relate to the process of how the final grade was computed and not the quality of a student’s work.\\xa0 Appeals of the grading process may result in a lower grade being awarded.\\xa0 Students have one term beyond when a grade posted to submit an appeal.\\xa0 The appeal of a grade from a course offered during a student’s final term before graduation must be appealed before graduation. Grade Changes No grade may be changed without the approval of the Dean after it has been submitted to UREG (University Registrar).\\xa0 The Dean is not authorized by the faculty to change a grade submitted to UREG (University Registrar) except when an instructor certifies that because of errors in calculation or transcription, an incorrect grade has been submitted.\\xa0 Extra work to raise a grade, once submitted, is not permitted.\\xa0 The College limits the time in which a grade change is approved to the fall or spring semester following the one in which the grade was received, except when there is indication that the student violated the integrity of the course. Incomplete An instructor may offer, with the dean’s approval, an extension of time for the completion of requirements in a course.\\xa0 However, instructors may not offer additional work to raise a grade once a final grade has been submitted to UREG.\\xa0 Unless authorized by the dean’s office, students must complete all course work before taking the final examination in a course.\\xa0 Students who are granted an extension of time have 4 weeks from the end of final exams to complete the remaining course work.\\xa0 If the remaining work is not completed, a grade of IN becomes an F\\xa030 days after the end of the examination period.\\xa0 Extension of Time forms are available in\\xa0Monroe Hall 101. Intra-University Transfers Transferring into the College Undergraduate students enrolled in other schools at the University may apply to transfer into the College.\\xa0 With very limited space in the College, Intra-University transfer into the College is not assured.\\xa0 Students seeking to transfer into the College may submit applications in either the fall or spring semester.\\xa0 Prospective transfers are encouraged to visit the College’s website for current and accurate information about academic policies and application forms: http://college.as.virginia.edu/ . Transfer Return to the College Students who have been accepted for transfer from the College to another school at the University, but wish to reverse the process and return to the College, may do so before the beginning of the new semester.\\xa0 Once the semester starts, they remain enrolled as students in the other school and must apply as an Intra-University transfer student.\\xa0 Accordingly, a student who completes one or more semesters in another school of the University and then wishes to return to the College must also apply as an Intra-University transfer student. Leaving and Returning to the University Entering Students Whose Medical Circumstances Preclude Enrollment Entering students who for significant medical reasons need to discontinue their enrollment in the College before the semester begins must return to the University via the Admission Office, either as a deferred admission or as a transfer student.\\xa0 Students deferred by the Admission Office may enroll in courses elsewhere with the permission of the Admission Office.\\xa0 Transfer students must complete at least 24 semester credits of college work prior to matriculation. Entering students who for significant medical reasons need to discontinue their enrollment in the College after the first day of the semester must withdraw from the University.\\xa0 They may return in accordance with College policy on re-admission.\\xa0 Students who withdraw from the semester may take courses elsewhere with the prior permission of the Office of the Dean of the College, and in accordance with College policy on transfer credit.\\xa0 All such course work will be accepted as elective credit only. Enforced Withdrawal Students may be forced to withdraw from the University for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault that prevents the student from fulfilling the purpose implied by enrollment at the University. Further Information on Withdrawal For further information about voluntary withdrawal, medical withdrawal, and enforced withdrawal please see the University Regulations section of this Record.\\xa0 Students on financial aid should consult the Student Financial Services Office for additional information.\\xa0 Any questions about tuition and fees for withdrawn students should be directed to Student Financial Services as well. Leave of Absence The College expects students to register each semester and proceed to the completion of their degree programs.\\xa0 However, students may request to take a leave of absence, which is valid for up to two consecutive semesters.\\xa0 Students who plan to be away from the University in a subsequent semester (or semesters)\\xa0should file for a Leave of Absence no later than the day before the beginning of the semester the student plans to be on leave.\\xa0 Students may file for a Leave of Absence through the Student Information System (SIS). Students in the College who have been on an approved leave of absence apply for re-admission when returning to the University (see below).\\xa0 Students who enter a degree program at another institution, however, must reapply to the University as transfer students and are not guaranteed acceptance. Medical Withdrawal Due to significant medical reasons, a student may need to withdraw from the semester.\\xa0 A student may withdraw for medical reasons at any point in the semester, with the same conditions and restrictions applying as with a voluntary withdrawal (see below).\\xa0 In addition, students who return to the College after a medical withdrawal must be cleared by Student Health (see Readmission below).\\xa0 In very unusual medical circumstances, documented by a health professional, a College student who did not withdraw during the semester has one semester in which to petition for a retroactive medical withdrawal.\\xa0 If approved, all grades convert to W’s and the student is obliged to be absent for a full semester before resuming full-time study. Readmission Students should consult “Returning to the University” in the University Regulations—Academic section of this Record for policies that govern their readmission to the University.\\xa0 Application for readmission must be made to and approved by the student’s academic dean in accordance with the College’s readmission deadlines and policies (see http://college.as.virginia.edu/readmission ). In addition to the requirements of the University’s policies governing readmission, students in the College returning after a fourth semester must also submit a signed Declaration of Major Form at the time of readmission, although students returning for their fifth semester may complete the Deferral of Major Form in place of the Declaration of Major Form, which is valid for one semester only.\\xa0 To be readmitted for a fifth semester, students must have earned a minimum of 54 credits.\\xa0 To be readmitted for a seventh semester, students must have earned a minimum of 84 credits. Students may file for readmission through the Student Information System (SIS).\\xa0 Students will be notified in writing of the College’s decision on readmission.\\xa0 For readmission following a medical withdrawal, students should also follow the steps outlined by the Department of Student Health: https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu// . Voluntary Withdrawal Students may withdraw from the University before the conclusion of a semester, specifically up to the last day of the final examination period,\\xa0if they meet the conditions stated in the University Regulations section of this Record.\\xa0 A grade of W will be entered for each course in which the student was registered.\\xa0 However, students in the College of Arts\\xa0& Sciences who withdraw within 10 class days immediately preceding the final examination period are not permitted to re-enter the College for the succeeding semester nor to present transfer credit earned during the same time.\\xa0 Students who have received a withdrawal notation on their transcript for two consecutive academic terms (not including Summer Session or J-Term), regardless of the lapse of time between the two terms, may not apply for readmission to the University for one year and may not present transfer credit earned during the same time.\\xa0 Students initiate the withdrawal process with their Association Dean. Majors and Minors The faculty requires each student to examine one subject in depth to experience sustained, cumulative study of a range of related topics and issues over a period of several semesters.\\xa0 Study in a major allows students to focus on an area of interest where they would like to develop their intellectual capabilities.\\xa0 The faculty does not view the major as a direct path to a particular career.\\xa0 However, by developing a mastery of a particular area, students advance their intellectual capabilities in ways that will be of value in a range of later endeavors.\\xa0 The College also offers the minor in over thirty subject areas, but a minor is not required for completion of the B.A. or B.S. degree. For a listing of majors and minors in the College see: http://college.as.virginia.edu/degreeprograms. Concentrations Some departments and interdisciplinary programs offer concentrations along with the major.\\xa0 Students in these departments or programs may concentrate in designated areas of study that also meet the requirements of the major.\\xa0 Concentrations typically involve special topics, applications, or disciplines, and may include courses taken in other departments or schools of the University.\\xa0 A student’s concentration appears, along with the major, on his or her transcript. Declaring the Major Students must declare their major before the last day of classes in the fourth semester.\\xa0 The program must be approved by an official major advisor and the completed form must be returned to the College.\\xa0 Students who begin the fifth semester without either declaring a major or deferring declaration of a particular major for one semester will be blocked from enrolling in the next semester’s classes and may lose their enrollment place.\\xa0 No student may begin a sixth full-time semester without a declared major.\\xa0 Declaration of Major and Deferral of Major forms may be obtained on the College’s website and submitted electronically. Declaring a Minor Students intending to minor must complete the appropriate forms in the department or program no later than the add period of their next to last semester in the College (normally the seventh semester). A copy of the minor form may be found on the College’s website and may submitted electronically. Courses used to meet Disciplines\\xa0requirements in the College and the second writing requirement may simultaneously be offered in fulfillment of a minor, except that world language courses through the intermediate level may not be included as part of a minor, except the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean minors in East Asian Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. Distinguished Major Students who show exceptional promise in their major field of study may be eligible for admission to the Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) within their department.\\xa0 This program consists of at least twelve credits of advanced work and a thesis, special project, experiment, or exhibit based on at least six credits of supervised research, advanced laboratory work, or advanced study, as determined by the department.\\xa0 Successful completion of the program with a University cumulative grade point average of at least 3.400 will qualify a student for graduation with distinction, high distinction, or highest distinction. Interdisciplinary Majors A number of majors\\xa0are considered\\xa0interdisciplinary.\\xa0 These include American Studies; Archaeology; Bioethics;\\xa0Cognitive Science; East Asian Studies; Echols-Interdisciplinary; Environmental Thought and Practice; German Studies; Global Studies; Human Biology; Jewish Studies;\\xa0Linguistics; Medieval Studies; Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies; Neuroscience; Political and Social Thought; Political Philosophy, Policy and Law; South Asian Studies; Women, Gender, and Sexuality;\\xa0and a self-designed interdisciplinary major. Students completing an interdisciplinary major may submit up to three courses toward the completion of another major.\\xa0 However, both the sponsoring program for the first major and the sponsoring department or program for the second major must appove the sharing of courses for both majors. Students\\xa0who complete the Global Environments and Sustainability track within the Global Studies major may count up to 12 credits of advisor-approved electives outside the College as College-equivalent credit. Students wishing to focus on an area for which there is no departmental or interdepartmental major program may apply to the College for acceptance in the Interdisciplinary Major Program.\\xa0 Such a plan of study must include at least 30 credits of courses, in addition to a 6-credit thesis. The program must also be approved by three faculty sponsors, who will serve as the student’s major committee.\\xa0 Details are available in Monroe Hall. Major Course Restrictions All courses used to meet major requirements must be taken on a graded basis.\\xa0 Beyond the courses required for the major, however, a student may register for other courses in their major field on a CR/NC basis.\\xa0 Courses used to meet Disciplines\\xa0requirements in the College and the Second Writing Requirement may be offered in fulfillment of a first or second major.\\xa0 Courses applied toward the major may not be transferred from another institution to the University except with special permission of the department.\\xa0 Double counting of courses requires the permission of both major departments or programs. Credits applied toward a major may not be applied toward a minor. Major Subject The faculty requires each student to examine one subject in depth in order to experience sustained and cumulative study of this subject.\\xa0 Thus, all students must enroll in a major program of study offered by one of the departments or an interdepartmental program.\\xa0 The major program will have no fewer than 21 credits; it may also require up to 12 credits in related courses.\\xa0 Students may declare a second major in another department or program, in which case the application for a degree must be approved by both departments or interdepartmental programs.\\xa0 Students receive one diploma, but the double major status is reflected on their transcript.\\xa0 Students who double major must submit at least 18 credits in each major; credits applied toward one major may not be included in the core 18 credits of the other major, and no more than two courses can be counted simultaneously for two majors unless one or both majors is interdisciplinary (see above). Minors in the College As part of their undergraduate coursework, students may declare two minors minor offered by one of the departments or programs in the College.\\xa0 A minor consists of no fewer than 15 and no more than 24 credits of graded work in a program of study approved by a sponsoring department or program.\\xa0 Courses used to meet Disciplines\\xa0requirements in the College and the Second Writing Requirement may be offered in fulfillment of a first or second minor.\\xa0 Credits applied toward a minor may not also count toward completion of a major.\\xa0 College of Arts and Sciences students may declare a maximum of two minors; no more than one minor can be a non-College minor.\\xa0 As with the major, courses taken on a CR/NC basis may not be included in the minor program. Minors Outside the College Any student with no more than one minor in the College may also declare a minor in one of the other undergraduate schools in the University that allow College enrollment.\\xa0 However, students who declare a minor outside the College must keep in mind that courses taken in these schools count as non-College credits unless they have been approved as noted above as College-equivalent courses (see section on Course Rules). Courses taken for the Urban and Environmental Planning minor in the School of Architecture may count as College-equivalent courses only if the student completes the minor. Study Abroad The College encourages all students to study abroad.\\xa0 Students participate in study abroad according to the guidelines below; students interested in study abroad should consult the information available in the International Studies Office in Minor Hall, which handles all applications for study abroad.\\xa0 Further information is posted on its website: https://educationabroad.virginia.edu/ .\\xa0 Students should confer with their major advisor early in the process of selecting a Study Abroad program.\\xa0 Students may also consult with their Association Dean and with the Director of Undergraduate Programs in their major department. Eligibility Students must enroll for their first semester and at least one additional semester at the University in Charlottesville and complete no fewer than thirty credits before being eligible to study abroad.\\xa0 Thus, new students, either first-year or transfer, may not apply for study abroad until they have completed a regular fall or spring semester at UVA and are enrolled for their second semester; they may not begin the study abroad program until after completing their second semester, with the exception of J-Term study abroad programs.\\xa0 First year students who enroll in one of the UVA First programs, UVA London First\\xa0and UVA Valencia First, are exempt from this rule. To study abroad, students must be in good academic standing and have a cumulative GPA at UVA of no less than 2.500 at the point of application to study abroad.\\xa0 Any student who does not meet either criterion must submit a petition to his or her Association Dean to be considered for an exception to College rules.\\xa0 These standards apply both to direct-study programs and the traditional study abroad programs under auspices of another institution or organization.\\xa0 Participation in study abroad is on a competitive basis; acceptance may be based on criteria beyond minimum cumulative GPA. With approval of the student’s Association Dean and the major advisor, students may study abroad in their seventh or\\xa0eighth semester.\\xa0 Students who do so accept the risk of not graduating on time if their grades, for any reason, are not received by the deadline set by the College Registrar. Programs Students study abroad either in one of UVA’s direct-credit programs or in non-graded transfer credit programs sponsored by other institutions.\\xa0 In UVA direct credit programs, students enroll in UVA courses and receive grades. \\xa0These courses may satisfy general education, major, and minor requirements.\\xa0 In transfer credit programs, students enroll in programs sponsored by other institutions.\\xa0 Grades do not transfer, although courses must be passed with a C or higher for credit to be considered.\\xa0 Credit from transfer credit study abroad programs may not be used to satisfy general education requirements, with the exception of the world languages requirement, which may be fulfilled with approved course work in a country where the language is native.\\xa0 For transfer credit programs, the College strongly encourages students to select programs approved by their department and listed on the online database of programs maintained by the International Studies Office.\\xa0 Students in the College may transfer elective credits from these programs approved by ISO and listed on the transfer credit database maintained by the College.\\xa0 See http://ascs8.eservices.virginia.edu/AsEquivs .\\xa0 A maximum of 60 non-UVA credits from other universities, foreign study (the University’s direct-study programs exempted), advanced placement, or dual enrollment may count toward the 120 credits needed for the B.A. or B.S. degree in the College. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students enrolled in UVA direct-credit programs are expected to meet the College’s longstanding criteria for good standing.\\xa0 Failure to do so will result in the academic sanctions of Academic Probation or Suspension.\\xa0 Students participating in semester- or year-long Study Abroad programs (not summer programs) are, like their full time counterparts in Charlottesville, expected to complete at least 12 credits each semester.\\xa0 Whether on direct credit programs or other approved programs, students who study abroad for a semester use one of the full-time semesters of full time study they are allotted. Transfer Credit The College grants transfer credit based on an analysis of the content, level, and comparability of the courses taken, the applicability of the courses to the student’s intended major and degree program, the quality of the student’s performance in the courses, and the accreditation of the institution at which the work was completed. Some transfer credit taken before matriculation may be used for fulfilling Disciplines (or area) requirements, or for fulfilling major requirements with special permission of the department.\\xa0 However,\\xa0credit awarded as “X000T” credit will not count towards fulfillment of any general education requirements\\xa0for traditional four-year students.\\xa0 External transfer students may\\xa0apply X000T credit to fulfill area\\xa0requirements (Disciplines requirements starting in fall 2025).\\xa0 External credit may also satisfy major requirements with special permission of the major department or program.\\xa0 However, dual enrollment credit may not be used to fulfill the Literacies general education requirements.\\xa0 All students in the College must take the second writing requirement in the College and earn a grade of at least C-. Current students must notify the College of their intent to study at an external institution by submitting a transfer credit request form prior to enrolling in courses for transfer.\\xa0 Transfer credit is allowed only for those courses in which a grade of C or better has been earned.\\xa0 Courses in which a grade of CR is received must be certified to be the equivalent of a grade of C or higher to be accepted.\\xa0 Only credits are accepted in transfer.\\xa0 Grades do not transfer and do not affect the student’s cumulative grade point average at the University of Virginia. Transfer credit is evaluated only for the degree program to which students are admitted, and the amount of credit awarded is subject to change if students change degree programs.\\xa0 In the College, the amount of transfer credit awarded and the number of full-time semesters previously completed determines class standing.\\xa0 Only 60 credits of transfer from other universities, foreign study, advanced placement, or dual enrollment may count toward the 120 credits needed for the B.A. or B.S. degree in the College.\\xa0 For more information, see the Transfer Credit section of the University Regulations. Advanced Placement (AP) Credit The College accepts College Board’s Advanced Placement (AP) Program by awarding advanced standing or advanced placement and in many cases transfer credit to entering students who have made specified scores on AP exams.\\xa0 For more information on transfer credit received based upon specific scores on various AP tests please consult the table found in the section on Admission in the general University section of this Record. International College-Level Examinations The College of Arts and Sciences grants advanced standing credit and advanced placement for qualifying examination scores in the Higher-Level International Baccalaureate, the French Baccalaureate, the British A-Level, the German Abitur, and select other examinations.\\xa0 We award advanced standing credit or placement based upon qualifying examination scores (and, where applicable, subject coefficients) and the recommendation of the appropriate Arts & Sciences department(s).\\xa0 Students who have taken the IB or British Advanced Levels are referred to the tables provided in the University section of this Record under the Admission webpage.\\xa0 Credit and advanced placement are generally determined on a case-by-case basis, on the student’s initiative, by the Dean’s Office in the College of Arts & Sciences and by the Director of Undergraduate Programs in the appropriate department(s).\\xa0 The College does not award credit based upon the length of study of a particular program.\\xa0 Since approved credit is advanced standing credit, not transfer credit, we base the award of credit solely upon examination results and not upon completed courses.\\xa0 The College does not award credit for foreign language subject examinations of English language or literature. Advanced standing credit is included among non-UVA credits on the student’s transcript and, along with transfer credit, is limited to a total of 60 credits.\\xa0 The College of Arts & Sciences and individual departments may limit the number of advanced standing credits awarded to an individual.\\xa0 Students may receive at least one, and not more than two, semesters of introductory-level credit per qualifying examination score.\\xa0 Departments have their own policies on the use of advanced standing credit for their major or minor requirements. To receive credit for other international examinations, students must provide an official copy of their examination certificate, including an official English translation if requested.\\xa0 The certificate should be sent directly to the College of Arts & Sciences, P.O. Box 400133, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4133, or delivered in-person in a sealed envelope.\\xa0 Students must be prepared to provide to the departmental undergraduate directors official course descriptions, syllabi, and copies of examinations.\\xa0 We encourage students to contact us and the appropriate Director of Undergraduate Programs if they have questions about receiving advanced standing credit or advanced placement for any of these examinations.\\xa0 A list of the names of the Directors of Undergraduate Programs and their emails and telephone numbers is located on the College of Arts & Sciences website.

Program in which students pursue independent research into a topic of their choice, based on their academic, or professional, or personal interests or some combination of these, and write a substantial paper that reflects a deep understanding of the topic. Students will present their research to an audience of faculty, students, and others at the end of the semester. This required course provides students an opportunity to strengthen their critical thinking, research, and communication skills while exploring the process of research and project design. Students will apply what they learn to develop a thoughtful proposal for their Information Technology Capstone Project. Before registering for Capstone Project I - ISCP 3991, the student must have successfully completed the Liberal Studies Seminars requirements, have completed at least 105 credits toward the B.I.S. degree, including most of the concentration courses, have removed all incompletes, and be in good academic standing, that is, not be on academic warning.

Elective courses can include those other than from the list of approved Cybersecurity Analysis concentration courses. A minimum of nine credits of degree electives at the University must be in upper-division humanities/social sciences (e.g., 3000/4000 level ISSS or ISHU courses or approved courses from the College of Arts & Sciences). Capstone Project I (3 credits) The Capstone Project is the culminating activity of the B.I.S. Program in which students pursue independent research into a topic of their choice, based on their academic, or professional, or personal interests or some combination of these, and write a substantial paper that reflects a deep understanding of the topic. Students will present their research to an audience of faculty, students, and others at the end of the semester. This required course provides students an opportunity to strengthen their critical thinking, research, and communication skills while exploring the process of research and project design. Students will apply what they learn to develop a thoughtful proposal for their individual Capstone Projects. Before registering for Capstone Project I - ISCP 3991, the student must have successfully completed the Liberal Studies Seminars requirements, have completed at least 105 credits toward the B.I.S. degree, including most of the concentration courses, have removed all incompletes, and be in good academic standing, that is, not be on academic warning. Students also must have attended the Capstone information session and filed the Intent to Take Capstone Project I Form at least two months prior to the start of class.',\n",

    "The probelem with this approach of using the retrieved documents as the query for the courses is that it is too long. I also tried doing it with all the same query, but im worried we con't be able to get all the courses we necessarily want. With the same query, the outputs for the classes arent bad, but its just a random selection of cs classes. Here i propose we do a multistep thing where we retrieve the major and school documents, feed it to the llm for generation, then use that generation to query the classes databased, and feed that back to the llm again for our final output.
